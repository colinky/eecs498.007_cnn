You know what I do is write for the children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a kid, you read in America.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather leather and never chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that was somewhere else.
You just have to turn the apple on to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed to bleed every week in the <unk> until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom school.
It was doing it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that of adults never got to know us.
You could <unk> Ohio and please bring that man I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, I would like you to marry this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it
It's something we knew how to do.
And as a woman who wanted <unk> as adult arrived at <unk> it became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was, the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I spoke to you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> to me around the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think it was about a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up the end of the end, whereas others can't even get them more and get involved in a <unk> <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing out of its atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg melts by a iceberg releasing fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I approach me to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and it won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way in the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually be really going to see a <unk> iceberg to see.
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved on the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg from its average size.
<unk> about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so you know, the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each <unk> a baby -- OK.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much at the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the concept itself, they're not going to pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and sperm joins the X X chromosome.
And in the other case, the sperm chromosome is joined the X X chromosome.
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground activity, I will get two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people address the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how have the body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> <unk> individuals whose physics typology does not fit into male employees and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in the common forms or a female or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is whose <unk> gene -- and he says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that <unk>
And then, in <unk> <unk> the testes are getting testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developing on a course of typically <unk>
When you <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not even until puberty, when it's growing up and developing breast but not the amount of time, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then you can make you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you might think it's a man, but it's not really not.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a female woman, don't know the <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman. Most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with the testicles who has <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he took a life as a boy and he had just found out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had 20th century chromosomes and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, essentially, a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th people develop what's known as <unk> -- is they have tissue <unk> wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are lots of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies were doing -- they are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> are <unk> to surgeries, not to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they <unk> to various surgeries is that they are threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having a black identity -- to be black, and it means having African anatomy in historical terms.
Very simplistic idea.
And when you show us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very pristine ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk>
Imagine how surprising it is to have children born as two people within one body.
The most high recent case is the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What a test is going to do to determine whether they're <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there's no such test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, more we need to admit that these categories -- we were thinking of these these categories as a stable <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- they're much more than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you think about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we believe in science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead, when you're considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of they would put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it still doesn't <unk>
If you stopped moving it up.
But we can, for example, extract their life organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of figuring out really death of someone. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with bodies with bodies -- but I have to admit it gives me nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It takes us from the concept of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first of all, I have to admit that I am an fervent fan of wise people.
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so sweeping in what they did, that I find myself every single seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with stereos.
People were <unk> they were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did -- it was a <unk> concept, and they tried it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember it, what we <unk> our surrogate <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world did not know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of a birth.
They had the blue <unk>
They were from the idea that the political power was coming up with the right of the grandfather for the father and then the son, etc.
People were rejected by <unk> that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, and that was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing because they were part of a <unk> system, where two things were made.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time we would get the science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the history of privileged farmers, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to emerge from a vague idea of the right birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at, for example, the Declaration of adolescence, they talk about nature and god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement for <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what's next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people from color that we would have the <unk> <unk> about the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some divisions <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say we should do it to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years were allowed to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> creatures at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before <unk> June 1 of June 1980.
Okay, Henry, in the other hand, was born in term: was born at March 1 in March 1980s.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before to Henry the right to your sexual consent -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the slogan that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on your part, don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can be married in every state with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in many aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went both on the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy is based on the anatomy might <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught up in a rare position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to marry a man you don't have to have a chromosome -- and you have to get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests with the people.
But this is also very strange because of the story I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> it offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to provide rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of them <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> intelligent decisions, about their sex relationships than people than 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of <unk> content.
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless they are willing to submit to a change of sex in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago that I had made <unk> twins and then pick up his name.
But when the phone was asked by the operation, it was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to.
I said, "Well, he has considered political asylum rather than the separation <unk>
The United States offers enormous possibilities for people who are <unk> to change for the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to conclude, I mean, I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation at <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a renaissance -- and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> -- particularly if you're thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, not all of all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in grad school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me an <unk>
<unk> what about feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I think there is a little female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the people were really excited to figure out how to protect people from the state, it's possible to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we find democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect time, think about what we do for others.
Thank you.
In 2007, 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go to live and work, have the possibility of choosing between least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this moment we are far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to be willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily <unk> the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But we just had to take away from buildings at apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and that the other half is still not <unk>
You could try to increase the ability making <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building of building construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, building a completely new apartment building on it, always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that governments will build new areas of reform large enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections, <unk> <unk> has been <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say you can't go and account for all the current residents.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala friend sent a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They got me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we put together in Miami, a conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument -- and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which involved an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport now covers over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk>
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a city of a city that could be going to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And they also need new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with them and help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could rely on the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could also take a thousand square kilometers.
And so soon after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in the <unk>
On February 17, it passed over again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of the 21 to 24 to 24 to 30 <unk> it went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korea, it's bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years after four years and getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this so practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and maybe it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new system.
There are urban and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know you've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are lots of companies that want to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change to another place.
There's one million a year out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents that have to leave back to their family to go get a job, sometimes they are unwed mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you, <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a confession public and that is, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and most recently, photograph and post on my blog <unk> and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand from <unk> markets and stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce my impact on the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are passionate about -- my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my own personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I will love me?
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the topic of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would expect, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what suit.
I've brought it seven pair of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly one week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else I would like to use after getting here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as a woman who walks for TED in underwear --  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons in life that, believe it or not, I have learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk> bright.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see a phenomenal thing for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a little bit of <unk> too.
<unk> <unk> from the child that you're going in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, you have no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody to this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal kind of personal type is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you need to leave it back certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I come up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For instance, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where does your brain do at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not a mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, who just like most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need quite a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed over the age of the years is the one that says one thing can be only at one place at once.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, they always got off.
But I bet you would play with that bar bar -- it taught him a precious lesson, and it's that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars -- play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes they play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, never no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit right to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow all of the principles of mechanical <unk>
I don't find the reason why I didn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit in the center.
And then here we do a very large approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a way of springboard and that <unk> supported on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip chip and I started working all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a <unk> form of swimming in the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum voice, but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird, but then when other people go up with you to do those things, because I don't want them to do it, or actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of journey of inanimate objects are not just people, but it's the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
It took off the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then they put it down to a temperature of less than a degree on absolute zero.
Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. and the way it <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logical part that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you acting your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about talking about that quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It is more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so on.
Many negotiations and stories, you know, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is simply explaining to this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- I didn't get married, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than show the demo, and then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all of the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite favorite, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and, <unk> we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate for the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
You're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
You keep going. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks <unk>
And I walked in, and I discovered the kids were actually playing something.
And we did a little bit, I talked to some of the <unk> and I actually found out that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole with a pole <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pass the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is for coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and actually <unk> it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this painting, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things more here, but I don't have <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can online to create your own museum -- create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, you go -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just <unk>
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery.
You can write things, you send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when I looked at these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital state to do justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question you do today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's for supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm about Italian, Italian, all kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in the year of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
So some time, if you wanted to win a year career, one, I would take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what we could, in engineering, the system of control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered and electronic networks.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> uncle, <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all of the atoms in existing atoms come back and get sensors into it.
And that's changing the interaction as we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old <unk> dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said screaming, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he said <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of luck in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some remember remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I finally won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
In the afternoon early there are people over here and there by doing <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> from France.
People do a fast call and goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> time.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everybody went to the center of the winning team and the first minister of time.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the origins of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that in all modes of <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one <unk> into the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> doesn't miss is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped a day is still there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about, at first, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how do the technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that you have a <unk> and a <unk> valves who are open and <unk>
It creates like a water <unk>
If you fall the pixels to the pixels to be written in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And if you zoom in, the curtain will open that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And they had a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you come up and opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it works.
You see the people taking care of what happens in.
And here I am myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really more fun.
All the <unk> kids came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use to use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, that way.
It's sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal spot in two dimensions.
Or they do normal but in three dimensions, where what it changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can walk up and see and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them on a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet today, the star of the New York City star and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capturing them in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels to the pixels to play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as a <unk> farm as a <unk> farm -- but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of them, a little bit of a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama Obama campaign -- we can move out of the digital world, the <unk> power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how will happen from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together together differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel ...
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve the main moments of today's prevalence of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of heaven as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are doing?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, you might improve the <unk> for a more accurate more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better form, be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you tell you about it?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people embrace creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably owe to the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many of you want <unk>
Some more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED conference -- but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The big <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology makes sense for the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution -- consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the most interest we're interested in.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asked them about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is an beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It is warm dark, wet, electronics, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that you can want without effort on their part.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush hasten to the output.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are the future?
We're in sort of an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and unique <unk> and human life, a little note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two unhealthy cells.
But when organisms come along, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, thinking, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90s.
And one night you hit your hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He's doing it <unk> says, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to regain health at disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthier.
Evolution is going to happen the genome to the next <unk> adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like Wal-Mart rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all knew the feeling that he expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily have longevity.
It doesn't necessarily have the biggest or the stronger or the most intelligent and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish so that they were limited to the empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we start to think about the time of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead to the <unk> phase I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is not <unk>
We've had a kind of balance.
And underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we get so hard to be able to be able to have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that you create a natural human type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a species -- distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive and intriguing possibility is intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution that is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what makes it on the individual and family level.
Think about it, if you could choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and she sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at close to 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of course for us to make the human genome for <unk> and it will be increasingly at all.
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can do viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves but are going to induce immunity to other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine with the flu vaccine of a plant plant.
Can you imagine a good thing coming out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg -- and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, remove the diabetes, to eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes for preventing disease going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of putting this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want to turn the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can get them back to 1,000 years and maybe it was happening within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose different attributes we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about flight flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem, you probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already scratched the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things later, at the same time.
The pilot, the plane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
We replaced the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words ...
So the three <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to make before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to get in, and I didn't do that, all the experiences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I got a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to read it, nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while we <unk> the bridge George Washington -- I thought I wasn't quite -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, it also gives place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we <unk> in things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have reason to feel <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock goes <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I came out, I had the sense of, Whoa! I died not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason to be in the world.
And at that point, I understand those two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and back and live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please not be -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What do you <unk> they still do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How to change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day he came home after he came home and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the start of ALS.
Today <unk> has complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation, so obviously graffiti is a kind of intricate we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with learned can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be a big one, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way. They are marking with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check that had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I sat down with his brother and his father in that very moment, so now, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inner self can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research, which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer about that and record the negative space.
So they're going through art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that we can <unk> I could take a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know." This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from the whole world from every corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, and the kids and I, we moved to the emergency garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they <unk> they would have taken off the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> And you can see the <unk>
These are a pair of cheap sun that we bought on the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera <unk> we put it together on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds yourself, we published the <unk> code -- the software is low in the way free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no company that I say.
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That's impressive.
So at the end of the two weeks we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of designing intense surveys of all night, Tony came back and drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust out in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to <unk> and get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a Blank.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to fix them and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the most best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up closing the <unk> is that April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it happen.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want we all to do every day when we find something that we feel like you need to do. If it's not now -- if it's not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in which situations are usually very difficult and at the same time a little dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
It was in <unk> and dangerous zones of <unk>
And I spent 30 days eating just a lot of this fun -- something in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been focusing on situations in horrible appearance with the only purpose of trying to examine social questions in ways that they were doing <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that would be useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come up here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of my name on the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But he said that, it's a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I couldn't have been able to take him for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world.
And as I said earlier, I've gotten myself in situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be <unk> for something so difficult or as dangerous as to enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I tried to make a product of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom of the end, it has a brand images of the side, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this whole idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> You know, it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the <unk> <unk> in the title -- but we're going to make sure that we put up all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe they <unk> a shoe and become the most great shoe you <unk>
The most great car you've ever driven in "The largest <unk> ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> from "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, make them <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is complete transparency.
You'll see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea, the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help me to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it will be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> You don't <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One and a half million and a half thousand <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big realities.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, let's look at us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to deal with the film or for me.
JK: Two things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
And so I thought, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he went, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought we <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so he was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted nothing to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was going to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to get so many people to see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the whole media scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake, and that mistake was this one.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of Google <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that was introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: The <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices, being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it something changes suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that rare bear still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare journey, rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's pretty risky.
When I began to talk to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk>
We want you to take a story, but we want to create <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there is him staring at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in each story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take out of the script and go to the companies myself with my team.
So what I started to figure out is that I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies that you start to understand your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films, enormous, giants and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make films of giant Hollywood movies that the reason why their films are so successful is because of the brands associated with the brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're fine for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you to <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> will have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man to <unk> <unk> to <unk> on bar, whatever.
That's the general story.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little brand for them.
<unk> the kind of movies more small than <unk> we're rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, to remind people is the reason why this is what we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think it's a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you cool better, better than <unk> more <unk> more than <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of common?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Kind of unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray gray and things like that.
Usually I wear jeans as sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the same thing.
Woman: If you were a brand a brand -- it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2:
Woman 2: In part <unk> <unk> partly <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet pets.
They sell toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be an impression of Tom, but I often took myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could probably do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how your thoughts and your thoughts and feelings about it.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you are going to <unk> like people around you, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk?
MS: Next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like things <unk> I like things weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> why is that?
What's the <unk> What phase phase are you here now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of Russian picture are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patient, <unk> Great A: <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.)
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to get out of this.
There was a lot of madness on all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> brand -- the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They get very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think a few companies are just going into one of your strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend to have -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them <unk> and make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to get your sense of your brand, your brand, what would that be?
Are you a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk> <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like contemporary contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> -- <unk> <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're good, stable, familiar, sure, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they don't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how they now use MRI in order to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing for film to film.
We went to San Paulo where it is forbidden to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts in which companies are going into the schools with problems with problems with the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or the ones I've been most successful are the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> they took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? <unk>
Well, since the movie came out in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film came out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has been started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about provided to their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks -- that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get the people out of that, it's pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss to risk is preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to be afraid of opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, forward, I think we need to give it a fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
And more than not a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And that said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> has been presented by my good friends from <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, let's focus on the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED array of the TED array -- the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED <unk>
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus out of Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a Windows. Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to be able to do something with these pristine boxes.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they went through very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "That's a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working on that way.
If not, you don't do anything.
So that I called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for instance, a power plant plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we will spend the goal soon.
So we pulled out and put it into the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
Let's get all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much we <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential potential goals of the world.
We need theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals about goals, remember, it is definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a strong <unk> and it's probably sitting in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I saw them in an effort to raise their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious <unk> to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and its structures.
So for instance, the number of <unk> shows up on that code, you can't get <unk>
I started to research scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
It wasn't like this.
The results have been from the results of several weeks of hard work.
They put them in dead ends.
Still, we discovered that both digital <unk> would happen to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and big <unk> communicates with six fall, and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what's the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't need to worry about other targets for <unk>
So here I show you a few very interesting things that we just saw, I really am <unk>
That's the gray box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input stock values for example, from pressure sensors, and the vibration and the vibration and a vibration code, which is still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital safety system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For instance, in a energy plant, when the big steam steam goes down, you have to open off escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, of course.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And neither is the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for instance, in an energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden on a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>
It was as possible.
And if you do that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of targets.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower <unk>
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you a robot <unk> or others that will make users from wheelchair leave you and get back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing its speed, and help, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other <unk>
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take over your back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> it will take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Rights
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can make it <unk> 90 pounds of land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with big <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where do I want to go, and then raise my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now looking at users of chairs from wheels about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in wheelchair chairs all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation of it.
We talk about something that happens very young, with damage to the spinal column that will start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
Their only option, a lot of times -- for a brain injury, or somewhere else.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful success as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> who's using Amanda <unk> who was using 19 years of a spinal column and as a result he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches who sends signals into board, here on the back.
There are a few batteries that give you energy to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they do it with this very natural <unk>
AB: I was in the top of my life when I was a stranger sitting in the air, skiing down down the bottom of the air, and I went down to the bottom.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the <unk> movement.
Shortly after, a doctor went into my room at the hospital, and he said to me, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last amount of hope of my self.
<unk> technology.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to implement and all the users of <unk> all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Man of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their living lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, a evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a little bit focused on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big <unk> <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been sustained by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in the survival of the Bonobo.
The hunting and hunting and deforestation are doing you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos -- you can hear the laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex -- <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a <unk> game.
For us and the game is critical to establish links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobos Bonobos -- you see the root roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the story.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball game and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the origin of evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk>
And I just think in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is both in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like the <unk> and also how the game needs trust and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think, as that, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And this is the playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> the maximum ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate at the play, they can be the moment that it's the most urgent thing.
So <unk> to accept that this gift of evolution and play together together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling the poverty, you open fires as a captain of captain in a <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers are aware of a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career on the foot of the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that we certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just come before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked her to go back and would save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a <unk> building to save a live self, just because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and she brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen <unk> which was more or less had finished turning off the fire and entered the fourth main search for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for his home owner where, as he would expect, his trove was getting much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of home <unk> by the brave exhibition effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about the rest of it was that someone had had even a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as a volunteer firefighter I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they're for making -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about it: <unk>
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you're going to wake up now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks of concrete are made in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules to a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, as a buildings or a bridges at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And within a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's been estimated that you've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete, <unk> of the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little bit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete, of concrete, the transistor allows to create much larger circuits and more complex circuits at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't appreciate it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't get wrong in a wrong way.
The bricks have a code.
The green is the road, the blue is the stream, the rose and the orange line is the wire.
So you just put together a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
A blue with a green one makes light.
Can we put a button in the middle and here's a <unk>
If we change the button for a module.
So let's take this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower or slower it simply turns this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a massively growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to be <unk> to <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works like a light night, or why the door of an elevator is staying open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken it to design schools.
So for example, the designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the School of Rhode Island designers that have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have been done, an <unk> barrel for motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the dark.
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to get to all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking at the environment focused on the environment focusing on the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I think the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year, and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send them to the <unk> world.
They were working with <unk> <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in Boston.
Here it shows up as if I look at a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody has been caught when it is caught by snow because he knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a foot of snow.
How did it come to ask for aid in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a long last year.
They realized that the city has never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did as any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can take a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put one name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component here.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology from the Afghan government.
And it spreads <unk>
One of the systems of <unk> city systems by seeing this application realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are steals the batteries.
That's why he asks citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are going to use using it.
And this has been spread in <unk> naturally and natural ways.
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software generally takes a couple of years old.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they did for the normal channels would have taken it at least two and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the court justice of California that even the time has two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days and it spreads viral is a kind of warning behind the institution of the government.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not like in private companies like many people think that should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in fashion.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we are building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country who are contributing to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up through the government.
They feel such a great frustration that they didn't have to do it, but they didn't get it wrong.
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that get us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we don't have <unk>
Now, a lot of people have left the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made us out of -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way we think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the heart of health and information <unk>
It's the place that calls the calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined <unk>
He did nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music well and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a application, web and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We don't want that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this is actually going on this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up and found the garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to public volunteer collaboration too.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition of technological technology.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it could have connected them to the government services of being needed but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, they <unk> the communities.
If we call the animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think you're the input from the other.
That our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have I chosen to a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is <unk> our values and we will build our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
So underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot contempt.
But it is that <unk> that keeps us that that belongs to us that we funded as something that works against us, that other thing, and as a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we will have to make the bureaucracy that are sexy.
Because that's where the real work work.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have been <unk>
It's a group of citizen concerned that have written a very detailed report by 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have been faced with government, it's time that we ask, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can be <unk>
We can't get with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to explore the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- only we have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average of our members of our members is 28 years old that I do, to <unk> I'm a generation greater than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't really care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring the hands to the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking off <unk> <unk> a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we always were able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of the government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we'll be a swarm of voices, or we're also going to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning to have a special meaning.
A physician can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> you can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been <unk>
His parents were born on slavery at Virginia about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said it doesn't, I got back again and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to catch his time and her attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room, and I looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
So I looked at her and she looked at him, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and she took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come <unk> The two are going to be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you about it."
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked down, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "I just want you to look at three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell you, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so you <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to ask me, is you will always do the right thing if the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South rural. I have a brother a year older and a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> pack. I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me, and we went for the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's fine. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I'm <unk> And you will always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good.
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went on the <unk> and I would say, "Oh, not be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others who really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe you can do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for the <unk>
My father died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> they were 300,000 for prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore and Baltimore and 50 to 60 60 to 60 60 to 60 percent of all young people of color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is about better if you're rich, if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth causes the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear politics and anger are making us believe that these are not problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you fall on rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we show it to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before the law of the right to <unk>
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it comes to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without chance to go out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crime crimes, but if we deserve to kill them.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Out of nine people who have been identified -- he's identified one who is innocent and released from death row, of death.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation you could never ever fly airplanes if you were nine to each nine that would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I tell you about slavery today.
I tell you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and it lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are more people who get me close to me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell you, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our own history, for the first time with terrorism after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the segregation and decades of which we were seeking racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All of the time we do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome the segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany teaching about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know, it's good disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We could never be here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we and <unk> and <unk> would put us to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are dominated by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
We've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though being so rational, so committed to intellectual <unk>
With innovation with creativity -- development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are <unk> as well by the <unk>
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not just in the bright and <unk> but also the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality of injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together simply to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to go, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and get it.
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk> them.
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to do.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> <unk> me on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in stuff.
I have come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher than the worst thing we have.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, is not because you're a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to, it's not a <unk>
Even, if anyone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
So it isn't.
I really think that in many parts of the poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge us by our technology, our designs, or our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful, but in the form of the way they treat the poor, they <unk> them.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients about 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults as adults were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge a judge on what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night was awake <unk> For God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, has to have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old customer -- a <unk> <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> white customer was treated as a privileged white white white white <unk>
In the <unk> I found that there were been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only <unk> he had been sent to the court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And eventually <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this stupid case.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car, I walk around the court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man named <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He <unk> "It's you. I said yes.
And then I approached myself and <unk>
And I would love with my ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I entered the audiences.
When the judge came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk>
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how, the room was full of people, because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I saw the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I would look down the window, and I would start hearing all that <unk>
I would start walking over here and over there.
Finally, this old black, with a lot of worry, entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> I showed you, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant came across about the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up and looked at the <unk> looked at me and said, <unk> this audiences of audiences to tell this young man to keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds down to justice.
We cannot be truly <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> from <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of us here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious wish of the audience, of this community, to help in your senses, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to deal with the funds that are spending today in peaceful policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, over the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of cases of homicide are not <unk> in <unk>
The rapes come up to nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds were going to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is said that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think that is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong War on drugs.
That's why this is a dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, per small crimes against the property, rather than making those resources into their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of the punishment is nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that news media would be <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses get a lot of more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And because nothing else matters to us, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories -- to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us news news about seven days of week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe not.
Maybe, instead of change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change -- the scarcity of species, lack of water and <unk> we have no doubts about it.
As human beings, we are very good at overcoming the problems and, in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita <unk> inflation has <unk> all over the world.
child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy spent 25 percent of more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> and more and higher expectations.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> refrigerators -- TV, mobile phones, air and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and lately, exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good time, in war and peace, in depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually faster and faster.
And on this curve, to escape Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we today.
<unk> computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call computation and infinite computing, networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize personalized -- all over the planet, synthetic biology, to fuels the vaccines and the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the vaccines and the <unk> the digital biology, the <unk> the vaccines and the <unk> the digital <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I went searching for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story about Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth the gold and the <unk>
So the end of the Washington end to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal part.
It's tethered to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum thing so cheap we used it as if it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy shortage,
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of the energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about terrorism, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have power abundance we also have water abundance too.
Let's now talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager space ship to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
And in a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small fridge coming in.
It is able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water a day of any source -- saltwater, water, <unk> -- for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I will make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in Kenya that the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart mobile phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video libraries -- images, of books and music technology, <unk> diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes up when you get the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device with the talk, and because they have <unk> can be extracted from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the payload <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that wouldn't be <unk> calling the <unk> and first of all, to prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of plenty.
I call it the <unk> billion.
The white lines here are the population.
We just moved the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, shifting from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been before you add to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you say? What <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the biggest economic <unk>
These people represent tens of billion dollars in the global economy.
And health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the "Ok, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What do we put up these <unk>
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X <unk> is that young teams were guided by his passion with an hour, of course, to do things that are <unk> things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some already heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and find out how the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing to medical research.
And so far, I was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, between others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started to <unk>
And it's shown today that the machinery of human patterns of human patterns is better by folding protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion.
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three million new minds that we are focused on to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very scary idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Perhaps they believed that they were <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was caught up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 seconds, the <unk> of black <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was earning more than the average in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five centimeters high.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- he was called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the south of the China Sea, and above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture there, was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny things about <unk> remains fish that are coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid fund of soft coral, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
He once captured a alive.
I still wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to leave it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But there was no <unk>
We don't remember it.
They set up the starting point of starting to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at it, this is something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have stupid things, biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images to start by the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze this piece of changes.
And at the end of the course of <unk> <unk>
And that is what we want to do right now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they have done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal which is very abundant before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose some immediate animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous with big fish.
They become slightly frequent because the <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect it to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such as you saw a lot of fish in this area cannot be used -- or, usually not the use of the <unk> scientists -- because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that you can achieve a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past people that people can't conceive of it, because the starting point has been run by and it's very low.
That's for people who can see a marine marine area and they can benefit from vision to <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle <unk> for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can perhaps fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay simulation here.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay, 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were very touched by the film to talk about the story of <unk> why would they engage with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron, I do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see what the videos are made and how important it has to.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed like something very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Any one can be done in the Internet in a <unk>
Over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of those, get a myriad of hits and it wins <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities, communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of last summer.
<unk> was not intended to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this bargain that I would give to the video to be popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> presents us new things and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  That's Friday Friday. You have to start the Friday.   You all want you to get the end of the week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took <unk> and a lot of blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends will embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who are sharing this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an automatic animation with an <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year, they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a <unk> version of three million times.
So far, you saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats looking at the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version to the old one.
And then he was international made.
All of a sudden, the whole community of a sudden, which made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What could you have been written by this situation?"
In a world that you go up two days of video per minute, only the only one and unexpected thing can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I would be inspired by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you.
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and your humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million watched and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media -- a new kind of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity
As I said before, one of the celebrities of the world's <unk> Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the current media, but they take the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so long friends, friends, I'm going to see it now.
They become a silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I did it."
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn, <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when her father died, and an <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life was destined to be a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for she who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat turned into the dressed in dressed <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the pirate and the death.
As most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> first, we took my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> it down diving into each wave, and the vast and empty horizon, the vast and empty horizon, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were fooled by the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the platform in the face of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, was too much for it; and the first apple I did, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had then had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is made of salmon.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments of English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked at farms, then on a assembly line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Still, I found time to study English and get a title for an IT title of the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra <unk> in English and math, wouldn't matter what <unk> was supposed to be, which was mostly <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And I had <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating to determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we ran over our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares can be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women came out with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> and kids were trapped between two worlds.
They went subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic classical classical student with what I <unk> myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives <unk> <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many of them had help over the years.
And for that job, when I was studying my last year of a lawyer who chose the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't exist.
So <unk> anonymously <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into church and comfort in life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got into the ship.
The "no" ever had been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What do you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly talking was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were going to live in the brink of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career of law.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a newly new come in the scene -- and not just that it's right, but it's something that we will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being in it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> they wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, evolutionary optimism a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I went to a small group of people for the people who the slogan cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I did a giant pot of soup that all of us will get.
<unk> up to the night to reach the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life didn't change for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in Sydney -- when she died.
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a Buddhist monk came to us and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came to us now and we can now see that the men that would have come to us with <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the right thing.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a brave <unk> in each wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the constant vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and look at it, it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of what's here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> singer, <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when we Indians wanted to travel to a car and put it into the sky.
Now we do it with an airplane now.
At that time when I was born, the great prince of prince -- he had <unk> I took a bow and with a <unk> to the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great thing.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
And I was excited about this idea of losing the ability to enjoy a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket silver <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of hackers.
I had the sense of mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them out.
Get our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I threw up this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I took books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device that will connect the readers of the world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
They put the text with the image, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, "You know, your fingers on every light."
And so this --  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
So at a few moments, the iPad gets to me a <unk> the iPad knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but the magic of childhood, to those ideas that <unk> from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always given to me exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt up the iPad to release fireflies.
And, you know, they light your way on the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a child was that a whole galaxy was a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device within the device.
And this opens a map.
In any fantasy book, there has always been maps, but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's children's story.
In a story that is about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> haven't gone into the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and in a chapter, you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "Today I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between the magic, the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked a interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality and through augmented reality, you see a set of cartoons that appear about the interior plants in the house.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves <unk>
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology comes to one another.
It monitors the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves into the natural world and that magic, joy and love that we sit through through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we let the patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to an listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she stood up a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a breath of running on and down.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I set up the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I get married, send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him, too. So he can see what my weight is, not at the same time that I need <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my scale in a place and before I get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week that will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take away from their houses, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they go back to <unk> and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the cost of the costs of attention, <unk> demand for demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls, in the <unk>
We even have our cell phones.
We know exactly where the ATMs are ATMs in <unk>
And also where are the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up in <unk> space and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality, to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use their iPhone, and at the next weeks I use your cell cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to take it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at many universities, to help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you go from vacation and someone <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And also, I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be a messaging service or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was awakened to my first 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for me, but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you <unk> the <unk>
For me photography I had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to push the <unk>
<unk> like this: an building on a very small road <unk>
But he has an unexpected turn.
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or the pictures like <unk> dark and colorful again, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say there, I mean <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want you to look like it seems to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look real?
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What do we create the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
So here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if we existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which you don't even hear the things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine pictures is very important -- <unk> because otherwise something will look bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will go on to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images come with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is entirely composed of photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, I even did red <unk> the top of the island on the top of the island more <unk>
So to get an realistic outcome, I think it needs planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well.
If you do a good job when you take the photos that result can be very beautiful and a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start by showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general place.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this is what we usually see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that is new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
We eat more intensity because writing on paper.
Why are we saying technology curves in <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where you say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to look at, the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport technology as fast as <unk> last morning, we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There's no <unk> in the history of the technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years, orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these curves <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
Give me one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way you adopt the world?
Why new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is happening.
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of meaning to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different that we extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at long-term things.
The time scale that I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So you go back about two and a half billion years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around it.
If we look at the way those chemicals are organized to us an idea of how things were.
And I think there's theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is, at that time, there was about oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that gave them materials from the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most competent forms of oil.
But those drops weren't living in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get off, you have a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that are <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals together, they <unk> more chemists -- more chemists and more <unk> more.
They spend more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things got excited about when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution is a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two and two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I just did for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of dust that I try to hide to the airport security people.
But <unk> Tom <unk> -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things were <unk> very different and was that these cells started exchanging and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can swap DNA.
So for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be able to get communities that in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
That <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community become more <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came to come so much that they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community together in a string of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities -- we have communities with many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is no disease without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they weren't doing more special information <unk>
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the data that those communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the structures that are responsible for <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learning not to eat an fruit because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had previously built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system builds up those information structures that information really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated about it, in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now move through similar periods to organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer -- the video tape -- the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where we had some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next one, the language, they took less than a million years.
And next one, like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without recent online advances.
But now I design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make it differently.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine that does something that you can't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
And we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, to run all those programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to sequence numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to setting up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, was able to find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They would take those and get them to the rest.
And now we <unk> the things that I think is the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children are <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that were made of the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go again.
They have some mutations in.
And it tries again and it tries to start with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, within hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that you call the numbers in such a perfect way.
In fact, it's much more efficient programs that I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to test them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that you can get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I once was going on a 747 on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to deliver a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much faster.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we're all part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been spending enough time to let me give up part of my false <unk> at that.
Before I deal with my talk, I talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know that.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that he <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the game of game without being <unk> and anyone who tried to <unk> to the first base doesn't come at time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone than 10 strokes, it gets to come up four.
<unk> as the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Mayor of <unk> to run more than 400 strokes in a regular basis.
Now I think about this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm telling you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place -- and a dear self has two clogged arteries <unk> and his family doctor derives to a cardiologist whose record record is <unk>
But you know something?
She's getting better at this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This isn't working.
But I'm going to ask them to ask the question.
What do you think about the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I included, with the <unk>
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a unfinished student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> was studying a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, we would have the origin and the <unk> the branching to every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis is frequent and the <unk>
And even I even knew <unk> on how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were doing everything, you would know everything, or you can close it to the whole thing, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency emergency service where I was working.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I could go to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
And and reporting to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what I was sent by a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, and that's why it's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read about it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to ease the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes in it.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone nor did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have looked at it, it would have been able to contribute information.
Maybe I did for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to be interested in.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even familiar my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I sent it home, I didn't take a voice in my inner voice that was like, <unk> not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unsure that I even asked the nurse that he <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm going to be okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so it was that he signed up the high and the ambulance with the ambulance people took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad deal in the stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I would try to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking lot, where my car was in order to go home. So I did something that I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency emergency service in the way home.
And there another nurse -- not the one that I would leave from the lady <unk> before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most of the emergency emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists fear the people too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see <unk> patients.
The three words are: <unk> you know?
He remembers the patient that sent to her <unk>
I asked the other other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of having arrived at her house, after I was given the high high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance was brought to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters on <unk> which means a shock severe.
I just breathe and was blue.
Your emergency personnel <unk> all of their resources.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> it was in intensive therapy, and waiting for every hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days after it was obvious that we never will.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And in ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, <unk> or grandmother.
They say they never forget the names they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was terrified for that, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt single, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The embarrassment of mine I'm talking about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we made was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would get the stuff and made sure that I didn't get stuck.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I chose <unk>
Little with that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in a day <unk> it opened up the sky and finally went out and wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if you were going to raise the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, I would try to cease those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him out of penicillin and he sent him home.
But as he ran to the door he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to my <unk> my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made three words: <unk> you know?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
I had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can look at Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the upper upper side, and you can cause the close of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You know, you get antibiotics because it goes <unk> and he recovered at a few days.
And I went through the same period of embarrassment and <unk> and then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was brought to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
You put an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out normal -- a colleague who was checking the patient -- some kind of sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and I called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I had a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I looked at it and when you notice some kind of sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated on and they recovered well.
But every case I got to me, <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant have been for the last five years.
I was embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get sick and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard of someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I think I would have hard to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who don't know you can sleep, and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a <unk> personal study and medical failures to learn as possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black Black Black <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs are in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct.
In this country, dying 24 <unk> <unk> for medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medicine Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiplying every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with an chest pain, comes <unk> with eye eyes, and I encourage alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> by contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things like this.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't accept their symptoms always the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, I'll never get anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art, <unk> is already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance people to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students would go down to <unk> to go down your head and go, saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> medical <unk> is human, and they accept it, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn about how to teach others.
They raise their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They give the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and to support them for everybody to <unk>
And he works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings running the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am human.
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that said to pick a half a half a half a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed by a week to a group of CEOs of business.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that we would be able to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many people belong to nine minutes, and how many of you belong to an hour?
How do you run the way through those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing the <unk> of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for Please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water -- and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I had asked myself, why did I never buy anything?
This is the shelf of the oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked her, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that every single day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a <unk> just to the entrance to the shop.
We put it out there from six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, people were willing to stop trying to test it.
More people stopped when I had <unk> 60 percent, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Did you stop when there were only three percent of three percent of them to buy <unk>
If there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, you decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have <unk> <unk> less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices are affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this doesn't happen to us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about savings of about a million Americans, of about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of funds available in retirement plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save the future.
And we discovered that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds were <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that provide two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I want.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funds, the rate of involvement in the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those that they decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, more people will be constrained by avoiding actions or investment funds.
As much more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we will make, to optimize the well-being of the future.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that you make the decision, the <unk> even when it goes out against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and in health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively they go better.
The main reason is that we would be looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so we can contrast to a contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
I want to do that today four simple techniques that we've collected in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been much more than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, than today, less than today, less than today, less than today, than
People always laugh when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, get rid of <unk> <unk> choices -- there will be a <unk> increase in the cost, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent of 10 percent in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products to junk cats that less <unk> they increased the <unk> in <unk> for two big sales and lower costs.
And you know that the construction between today, in average offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, you have a 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better choices is the trust of David <unk> the Harvard.
All the employees of Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safe background of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know as <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking about <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people from this audience a vacation with everybody paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually saw more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, that in the second stop, but I can tell you that the second time it was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
And this brings me to the second technique to handle the overload problem of choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to move more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting is going to work out exactly how we got <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I gave the staff to staff who would think of the positive things that they were going on in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a <unk> increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For instance, this is a study we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in Route <unk> across the corridor of <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This rating framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something that they <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than we think about -- if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a nice <unk> decision buying a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows you completely <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, you have to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is they change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many options, 56 colors, a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you feel about it.
If you were always <unk> the default button in every decision, this is that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from many choices to days -- the <unk> button over and over again, and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few options to many, many choices -- keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order that the information is presented with.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Now, if you pick the future box of change, I don't say nothing about the preferences of <unk> in all ways you prepare for choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that we now have more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the <unk> <unk> problem -- <unk> <unk> alternatives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help handle <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years in the East Germany in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to record a text sheet, written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they were written with the wrong message they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of that someone could do this, how much that we would give to the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser color printer in any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow printed dots on every page that makes you a pattern that makes them and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to do a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> of the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone, it's very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, a lot of them.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online cases online, let me take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, -- <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media through banking banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The American secret service ago, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this account has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is <unk>
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> on importance that we see today is not driven by money.
Is there another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, the opinions, they motivate them.
<unk> as Anonymous is <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group is the United States of the United States the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands -- or, actually, I was.
<unk> the last fall of the last fall because of a <unk>
They would take the safety of the site and carried out a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack of <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do we call the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign authority by foreign <unk>
And they would turn it into <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters protesters <unk> the <unk> headquarters in April, 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government -- tools to intercept a huge scale, the communications of the citizens.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond today.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think hard about things like this, the obvious answer should be wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do it."
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
Now, if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we are going to live today, it will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of U.S. National Park.
These are the cows of my father, and the back of the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the largest part of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning, and I found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and the whole land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People were dying of their own warriors protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that the lions would be afraid.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because even helping the lions to see the pen a long way.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
And I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that light and turned out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
It was all about it.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity on the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights go.
As you can see, the <unk> you get out, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see lions when they come at night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used now by a whole Kenya, to scare other predators like Prison. <unk> and it's also using for oil elephants as well.
And thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools of Kenya, International International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses they don't have, and I show you how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid on the campers of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and she used to watch airplanes and tell me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become a aviation engineer and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like anything.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical inventions here.
What's the next one in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric fence -- one near <unk>
<unk> I know you've already invented electric <unk> but I want to make mine.
CA: You would have been <unk> once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> -- Richard <unk> -- you're a big thing.
We're going to take it in every step that I have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except for America, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
Now, sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would have spent my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed from a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public lunch.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
He said, "When I did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so holes, that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering from my country.
As long as I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One life without life was dead on the street, holding a child in her arms looking at her head without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
An enormous famine was beaten by North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only only survive eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also made more and more prevalent energy cuts -- all around me was completely dark at night except by the lights of the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how we left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But as soon as I learned that it's not only extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the refugees North Africa were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made of me when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station,
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> so I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official told another -- "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at asylum in <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why that, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be setting up going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a big challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
And even through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call my pride for mine.
Even though they went to life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam income to college.
Just when I was starting to get back to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money that submitted to my family, and as my family, my family was going to be moved to force to force a place of place in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to take it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked you all of them and he started asking questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me, but I fortunately believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe <unk> guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and refused to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the <unk> <unk>
I was going on between the immigration office and the police station, and I was desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so stunned that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the people who are more likely to do the most.
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they entered a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language, practical practices.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with relatives still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including at TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> Center, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> terrain.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles -- as if this is <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> terrain.
Like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert -- Los Angeles <unk> home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to take killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles -- South Africa.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times -- which, say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
And I was glad to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of the house, you see the effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see wheelchair chairs and sold as cars.
I look at <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of managing about 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> sliver we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come up with me because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, in Green <unk> we got together and we started planting our <unk> trees -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine full <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of a group paid for gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city went on on top and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, <unk> became <unk>
And I said to me, "Come on, right?
A criminal court order to plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more terrain.
It has <unk> miles of <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on earth does it don't look like this?
Let's get a plant to give a thousand, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of outcome.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South government.
I grew up there. Tell my children there.
I was excited to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
As an artist <unk> artist <unk> walls, <unk> floors, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became an education tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They are <unk> to see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at the night and were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad at me, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I see people who were so close to me, with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people go to steal your <unk>
So what I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the same time, I want you to raise your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was great, I told me their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant his mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in a volunteer.
If kids grow up, they eat <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you are growing tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this are being told -- if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind to what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing you're caught. I see kids that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them in coffee <unk>
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
Curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try and work out the kids out of the street, who know the joy and pride and honor to cultivate their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do the <unk> take their <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Matthew Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably agree with me that this is a very beautiful road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go <unk> and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a quiet road <unk>
The solution for that is to do highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has <unk> pore and water can happen through it, so that all of the rain water flow along the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't drink water and not <unk> water.
<unk> also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollowed out, all of the noise up, so it's a very silent end.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is it <unk> You see that on this road on the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface going through.
So first a stone, then several more and more and more and more, etc., you know, I won't do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you get off, they'll be <unk> and split from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you'll get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool and steel of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of <unk> in it.
And then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use it to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can rise, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is they heat the steel to melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
I was using an oven <unk> because I can't bring the big machine from <unk> here to the stage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show coming out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We did a lot of samples out there, and then the government, you really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last several years without damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples out of this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, and then we put them up with our <unk> machine and we went back to a try.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers bringing together these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even you can double the lives of the surface. It will actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this was also working.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts the repair.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk>
My father was listening to BBC who was listening to her little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
The Taliban screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was really, really happy.
"Now you can go to a school <unk>
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got <unk> of Afghanistan and made the girls were to school.
For the next five years, I <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect about where you are."
We had to hide the books in bags for the market that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us sitting in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
All of us knew that we would embrace our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally that school was <unk> a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of them.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is.
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where her daughter, my mother, my mother, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
He was left two years ago, just to convert our home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that her children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate his children.
During the years of <unk> I remember I had times when I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can stop your home for a war.
But there's one thing I'm always going to be with you, which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still don't want to do it.
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I've been driving in the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador, <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why we <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like my friend, <unk> for them, even though they even in front of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> it's not their real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter would go from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, it's the phone -- a voice had noticed that if he was sending her daughter to school, they would give him a try.
<unk> now, if <unk> he said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for his old man and make fun <unk>
What I've realized, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, it's often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school with <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
So let's think that these changes wouldn't last a lot, after the retreat from the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and to their parents who were asking for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls of <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I'd never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But never has a revolutionary <unk> style.
They've been almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the wave of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution, like <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and out of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, are carrying <unk> dignity and social justice.
You have shown a courage to go through the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of <unk> and brutal war and some loss of about 50,000 people -- we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a <unk> transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation, <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with an individual enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about developing capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Women's Women <unk> <unk> by <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders, of very unequal orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of women and our right of participation <unk> in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved, and so on.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first choices in 52 years.
However, little recently, the exhilaration of the elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day they were going on news.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the American government and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the killing of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their same-sex rights violations.
Our society, made up by a revolutionary mindset, it will spread more, and it has been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became iconic of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all to deal with it with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, choose to be wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices did not brought peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation together.
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing wasn't just women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election needed -- that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the feminine to need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an outrage of an outrage of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not just <unk> but also putting the mercy in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition -- being <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, sponsored by war, desperately desperately needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in existential ways of doing it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic, that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans the entire humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all people have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus -- it covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> the whole thing.
This is how it tells us -- "My mercy in all the things."
This is how it says, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That everybody is <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a <unk> question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody makes the same thing. Why she's left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just met at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma soul -- I would hold me to the head with a <unk> charged with bullets from <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> in love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the bulk of my career working for companies to <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of all, every single income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody believes that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of <unk> are men, and sexual abuse is only happening in <unk> relationships -- <unk> and long duration or saying otherwise, in the families, the last place where we would want or find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have said that it would be the last person in the world who was going to stay with a man who would stick with it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls who are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical <unk> because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy rainy night.
I was sitting on my side in the subway of New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university and <unk> university and worked at a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most impressed me in that first encounter was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had a lot of big <unk> <unk> and <unk> hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it especially at the beginning of the beginning, in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was so list -- that I had gone to Harvard -- that I had been passionate about helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why I was at that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future was so important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was left from New York and leaving my dreams of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I was sleeping, I quit my job and <unk> and I went together.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> that I was coming into my head at a physical <unk> and financial <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where you go into the scene those <unk>
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where you were supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe he bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another was kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that they needed those guns because of the trauma that lived on a kid.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message to me, and although I never had lifted my hand, my life was serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my memory back my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would ever do it.
I spent two times more in our moon of honey.
I was the first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- he was walking down the traffic and threw a little Mac a cold Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was terrified when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of every three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying.
So, actually, I had a great company.
So going back to my question, why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face their <unk>
The other question all the world does is, why don't you just <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase at the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of violence in the cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has made the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources, and manipulation of the family criminal system to protect the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still ask why it's just not doing?
I was able to go, because of a final <unk> because I was able to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, would have killed if it would go.
So I broke the silence.
He told everyone over the world: to the police, to my neighbors and my family and family and full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines -- <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are they <unk>
For some people it's a way to say "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> bred <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to us, and that they nurture their lives joyful lives and happy lives like women, wives and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor. of domestic domestic violence.
I got married with a cute man and kind of, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, ever is a soft gun going to my head in the hands of someone who says it will.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you, there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting their daughter, to her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love on my crazy love, the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Spider abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end up domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They had the abuse of light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic and fantastic people who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name's Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like that.  Fortunately, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario -- so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they come back, they don't have to be <unk> now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that chance.
These designs are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater over the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
So why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he would turn my back, and that he <unk> the hair.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there is very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I'm in.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape, to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to harness to make any money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that would get on. They are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and from <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is less than four percent, were not white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you're <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I didn't know about that.
But then what I would say to each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next web or a surgeon -- <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because we were the first.
If after this list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of writing the American American magazine or <unk> CEO or next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've seen your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you want, you know, if you want to be president -- you want to be president of the United States for 10 years, people will be president for 10 years, people will look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture I was going, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're getting into the personal field, but it was a child.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party -- a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a group of <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and achieve this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> I have to never use, except the previous couple of it, but the privilege I get is the ones that I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course <unk> us, and he was sorry, agent so I could keep <unk>
<unk> from these privilege in my way, I don't know what I am. and there are people who are paying a price for what they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the teenagers who were married and 86 percent of them were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there's only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me.
But how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
When I research this talk, I found out that we found out that we 53 percent of girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to the 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer waiting for is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is how they did.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my mind every day.
And if you ever ask, with some thinner legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a set of models, because they have the most bright legs and the brightest hair and the more <unk> clothes, but probably the <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the greatest <unk>
If there's something that <unk> from this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Now, photography has been my passion since it was enough enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't belong to me.
There were no conductors and there were no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very small care in the lighting.
In fact, most of them have been taken at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and five.
I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started asking for the tourists who were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened in the way that a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a displays of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time on a October week, and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always put the same picture, our <unk> perspective -- my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion of illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in my tracks and pointed to a red <unk> of the store of dolls that came from small back to previous tea.
And he described to me what it felt at five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we think is memories are memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
So today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you didn't go back to someone and ask him and ask us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> bird group.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are <unk> in the New World who are mostly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 confronted a high risk of extinction.
So why <unk> are important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> people to the bone.
They help to kill all bacteria they help absorb the anthrax that they would not spread and caused great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge huge ramifications of disease <unk>
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the old culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the high and under Egypt.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities, use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years away, and the reason is because they fall prey from consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs on <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> there's a huge bomb bomb, and the number of anger of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> they're going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on an online problem, it's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise.
When you go out of this room, I will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because they saw it because they saw it without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much smaller without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Coast of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we <unk> you know.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where we just decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we got to <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local people growing and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were ready to come to work on, and sometimes they didn't go through --  We were assuming the local people, in such fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't know anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes there were beautiful, <unk> and <unk> from night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it all of it.  And we said, "Oh my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought we just had Italians to make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they were doing about, what they did, and then what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> see the <unk>  <unk> seeing the waste that we gave them to <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are a <unk> missionaries and treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
I want to deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The little is <unk> written by <unk> who said about everything economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to have 27 years only to answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does it do for you?
You can never get a community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We didn't work from offices.
We met in a coffee.  We put together a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that the man has for his own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once you get to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, they were <unk> but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they come across.
So planning has this blind point.
The most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't survive to public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor in the business, which sets up with you in your house, at the kitchen table in your coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test at <unk> city of Western Australia in Western Australia here.
I was making a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
And I said, "I did something really, really, really hard.
I get rid of them --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they got involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business itself.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> they want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you any privacy, it has to be fantastic at <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to show you more <unk>
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurship is an entrepreneur in which it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils are no longer renewable -- and from a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do that.
Who will invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an extraordinary story that I read in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> met this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horsepower and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would bring to New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few moments, and there were very <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk>
And then I suppose I'll have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The youngest company, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to count with a great financial management.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the <unk> of the <unk> of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all new companies, <unk>
There is only one thing that all companies successful in the world have in common, only one: none of them was started by one person.
The word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment environment in <unk> in bars along with their dedicated dedicated bars who will do for you, what somebody did for you, what someone is going to ask you, what needs you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> who seeks <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door for bad time?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs to reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which gives shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
And the music always leaves the music.  There's a <unk> <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest <unk> of the U.S.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this led me a profound gratitude for the time and so on.
It gave it clarity the significant things about my current life.
But I would take for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let them catch up day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends I transformed the wall of this home house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die -- I want to be tested by <unk>  "Before they die -- I want to sit on the line.
Before I die of dying for millions of people to people."
"Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die from dying outside of the <unk>
Before they died, I want a more."
Before I die. I want to go to the <unk>
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This space abandoned it became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes and hope of people made me laugh at me, <unk> me and gave me <unk>
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving people <unk> and <unk> and remembering what's the most important thing for us as you're growing and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the middle of the civic center we did a kit -- and now they've made walls around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces, if you give us ourselves to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
<unk> is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
And if you think about death of our life, our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect on what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hopes, and fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help us improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
Not speech, but transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happen what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and mind in this: Never <unk>
When they sing our childhood songs, trying to say words that I couldn't even remember, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
Do you have the more <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me the year when I came up with each of the songs of my iPod and conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I was sitting in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and <unk> birthday.
They don't look like that?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds do not fit the concept of <unk> in society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that grow faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> living and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room, looking around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat whatever there was <unk>
As it was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the frustration and <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child that I saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been a few difficult moments in my family, times I wish I would be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change at normal.
The normal, because of the beauty that give us the differences and the fact that they're different doesn't mean that anyone is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, <unk> or not, the differences I <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift inside and honestly, the search for normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> progress and change dies at the moment we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher to give me a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of course, <unk> of these students with their great minds and their great books and their great <unk> words.
But as those conversations were, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students. They surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted them to experience some other experience as well.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to environment and health care -- and if we don't know what we don't know about this, work isn't done, and I think it's our responsibility as we haven't scientists have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that you can see that their science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that they study <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that they're doing stupid things.
Instead, as Einstein, is that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and analogies and analogies. They're ways of connecting and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about signs of <unk>
They have been asked why they're called <unk>  What do you call the <unk> or the bullets have been killed, and they pick up your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported too in the area of our brain and we are <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple line, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then providing graphics that we will bring back to our other senses, and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key things that can help everyone else open the door and look at the country of the wonders that's science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all of my favorite words is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined her much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you're looking for a public charge without matter and platform or principle, and when wins, do it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all of the politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament enabled the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the little-known name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by Parliament.
And they put him in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such a support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first record of the phrase <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It isn't. It's an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to just show you how words and politics are interacting -- I want you to go back to the United States right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There was all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the United States <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about making quality.
And they didn't even know that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and I always would have <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get rid of power.
They did not want to call him King by if he did him or her designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most precious <unk> more <unk> than it came to you.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invented the title. There was just before, but it just meant <unk> that we had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> chairs from small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign up and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a very ridiculous title and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite favorite, until I could figure out, the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama has kind of staying there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want you to tell you -- is that the title of President of America does not sound at absolutely so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed the title of <unk>
So I finally won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, <unk> appearance -- well, it was a uniqueness over then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the <unk> the <unk> and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when they tell them that they are now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to do with you.
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really reality changes the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to a <unk> mine in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices who talk about it, and about everything, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with similar tools with primitive.
Like each other, I take a cheap flashlight of light <unk> attached to my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches holding the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
She <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, which lost control and dropped <unk> in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep deep down that hole by risking their lives without pay, and often, dying.
I went home from that hole and went home, but they might never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people that I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world but not such a degree.
When we ended up talking very sad, I was really excited to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me up <unk> the stomach and, weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered the second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that currently there is more than 27 million people who are <unk> in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of us about slave slave parents.
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, you can prepare to entire families by generations for <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates the revenues of over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under violence and cannot escape.
Today the slavery operates in the <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable disposable people.
slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and weird show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at the temperature of 54 C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, to 18 at the same time, and they take them from the furnaces to go into trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> did I pee a lot of <unk>
As they were, they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, I was like, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said to me, <unk> doesn't do it. Don't do it here."
And I explained very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizen in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he complained that he <unk> it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> stones for miles on <unk> land to the trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge them and the kids would take them to their heads with straps <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They don't have anything to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had completely <unk>
When you hear the TED word often we think of sexual traffic and because of this global awareness I was told that it would be difficult for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was terrified of women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by a stairs <unk> that gave this dirty basement of light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you're known in the craft, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms and they have private rooms where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- they are forced to <unk> customers and alcohol.
Each of it is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse by their customers.
And standing in the <unk> I remember making sense of an acute fear -- and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be caught in that hell.
He just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and they have to touch a very difficult topic to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is going around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often associated with labor labor.
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families -- <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a portrait of family.
The black hands of black is the father, the blue <unk> and the red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet to be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to look fast.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen in a boat, two brothers, some younger children -- some young children -- it makes sense.
<unk> They were all <unk>
Kids are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> it was a little bit <unk>
He was paralyzed by fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear of fear is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not to flee and, like all of life has been treated with <unk> cruelty, it comes to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when I went to the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the one of the one of the <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And it would point out that these nets weigh more than 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
He ran down a road in Ghana with a fellow of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their bike.
We were asked to do it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would go out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed up this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that we put on the way and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of pictures about my head as they were putting it down to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children bound their backs, and as they were looking for gold gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in a well part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweating.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people carry on bags heavy stone bags that then they will be shipped to another area where they <unk> the stone to get the gold.
First of all, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the side, but if you look closer, and we see other lucky ones, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is likely to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> the debt of the uncle that force him to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 and the leg injury you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Still, he dream about being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of determination, to a remote possibility that inspires me so much respect.
I want to shine a light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll take testimony of them, and we're going to do everything that we can help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not about magazines. They are real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to know.
I hope these images take a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math applied and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like <unk> <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I would try to explain what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> --  we're going to see later on.
But the ballet demands extraordinary training -- extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain <unk> <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous ballet dancer dance.
In the last few years, it has become a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there really is a cure to be when we have an objective and an objective <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement that are no biological markers -- so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, you never do it.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test themselves.
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do -- as a kind of no conventional way to try it, you see, in a sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> strings <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds when you speak. We can imagine as dancers of a synthetic ballet because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- for example.
And as the ballet did it require an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as we <unk> and as the Parkinson's is affecting <unk> it also affects <unk> organs.
So in traces of the bottom you can see an example of the <unk> of string ropes.
We see the same <unk>
Make a <unk> <unk> weakness <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes so <unk> it appears at mass scale.
So these are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the patient <unk>
It wouldn't do to go to the clinic for routine.
Fast monitoring <unk> we could get targets.
We could do a mass of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local lines accessible for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call low price price and leave for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've had six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Yeah.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> you may not hear it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors for the disease of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of precision at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done fantastic work and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, what we would put up the project. We have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
So we spread ourselves into the dark, blank rooms and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We make thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin, even more perfect we do it as possible as possible, and we get involved in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent and a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization I was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The record of water recorded over 24 feet high, and more than three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the mud and leaving the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places from the people around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the <unk> <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I took them up and I had the honor that I was standing in me to clean up the photos.
And this was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until moved through myself.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of them who had over a hundred years some of them still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
And I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl who had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would not have the appearance of her itself, and that would be as tragic as having the photo photograph.
Over the time of the time, they got the more photos and it took more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people to <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> to <unk> a village north of <unk>
Once on the week we use our scanner in the computer libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
Could it be an hour. It could be a <unk>
I could make a months.
This <unk> had to draw as much as it guides the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> into saltwater, covered in bacteria, and even with oil, and it was even oil, all of it along with oil -- all of that over the time I continue to tell you, that's a major part of the project.
We couldn't throw the photo unless I was clean up, dry and have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have the guide of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos already <unk>
As he said <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of kind of relationship to the photos.
He had started <unk> she had been stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and her own face would not have been <unk> we were able to take the images into a single picture and put the whole picture.
When I picked their photos something about her history with us.
Some colleagues found the pictures at a fire station, between the rubble of a pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not so small now, but his two kids were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his photos his youngest son was 14 years old.
To her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look at, something I could remember from the past he had not been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
And after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined themselves -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up with more than <unk> photographs, the big <unk> -- most of them came into their hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families -- and hundreds of photos were totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take photographs all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, a child.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing we would take to look for.
So this was the project to restore little pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it was a huge difference in the life of the person who gets it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger, I'll bring something larger, using their talent for something that are not thin skin models.
And to end I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was going, I couldn't help and think about people and the stories shown in the images.
In particular, a photo with women of different ages from grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter, <unk> from our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create a slow camera that can create a slow camera in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I go on and put it in a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons spread inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember, that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a <unk> pack that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Some of the light <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel around the table, and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a <unk> and current <unk> and we make it run the same distance and we see it slow down to about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to look at that film?
A day? A week? Actually, all of a year.
It would be a very boring movie --  from a slow <unk> in motion.
And what about trying to do with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more time, this tomato will realize that, as the light resembles the tomato <unk> they keep <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and it bounces light inside and it goes back after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket, you can verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT? MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a photo at the low exposure, it comes very little light.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very pristine <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light out of the door. <unk> go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and it <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, just slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique choices.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what extent it is to be at.
When a laser project can be record a <unk> picture that, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our rebuilding it.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that we call collisions with what's on the way around the curve, the <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows
Or we could build <unk> able to see the interior of the body, <unk> <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood that's quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of today's health care next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> him a scientist, and it became science in art, an art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
We create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves, we remember, the time between each of those waves is only about <unk> of a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange <unk> Einstein would have strange to see this image.
The order that events in the world are sometimes going on in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can raise life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone, you can tap a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and you can put it up and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> for a change, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who are you going to have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Most of you today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
It's <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission on the E.U. introduced a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every domestic telephone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in your telephone company, or her Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this database.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people left to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all of this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to her, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're holding my life.
So I decided to do it a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't give you this information.
And at the end, we got a deal.
They take the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown on a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> <unk> <unk>
At first, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom up and pull out, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me. We talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to another, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to know what time they call each other, what time to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Berlin would never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today state agencies and businesses want to store so much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When return home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
Not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the physician who brought me the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why it <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> isn't genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
Just by accidents, the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to show you, I'm not <unk> and I don't want any of you in the room today.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've chosen to be disabled.
Go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- they're at the shopping mall, you're driving in circles in search and what you see?
16 places empty for disabled people.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There is a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk my home to New York, you might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe when they won't believe when they would.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were terrified that I was going, and if we didn't take away all the top note all there, I got my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the five years by putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I was using was just a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten kindergarten was a <unk> champion which has received many taps.
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as it motto
People who grew up had no problems with my faith.
But nevertheless, it seemed like a lot of fun that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> from dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all of the <unk> we were standing in <unk>
On summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> and put me warm together in my back, I fell into the Sargasso Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't get <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college by the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of the State State University, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet pet <unk>
And I all hate me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo of my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> <unk> in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk> The end will have a <unk>
I've got <unk>
After the end of it, we did <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater, crying -- historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asked me why and she told me that they could not make the stunt stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunt stunts either.
It was a piece of paper that literally had been born and they gave an actor without cerebral <unk>
The university was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
As I could, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was the extra one in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors are not <unk> brilliant <unk> not white, with disability.
You just sell to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, I took comics in New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedy he took when he landed on the realization that he was at the high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabs in the Middle East, without censorship and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then remind the time of <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight to the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went to a news program invited by cable to Keith <unk>
I walked up as if I was at a graduation dance, I went back to a studio and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the bank desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed as if I was able, in full time and hit my chair.
Something kind of fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never got rid of me and even as much as a child or older than me.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I put online clips to a comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for her."
A guy suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't know, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that would -- less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need to need all of our society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived in <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> at the New state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give the child refugees Palestinians -- a little bit of what my parents would love me.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a young people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small village to South <unk>
This is about <unk>
<unk> <unk> a small village to poverty and on the edge of <unk>
Without it, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no matter of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a man who offers him to take him back to dinner, and then for dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives it a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home your family.
They present a young one.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That child from that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small child trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing he pulled out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them money, the story of the <unk> of access to terrorism, to the violence -- being the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital -- the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to be in front of that hospital -- I was going to show you thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few youth leaders at a business issue.
<unk> about 90 youth leaders, <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate college student, I was frustrated, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from the point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who were normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the spirit spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
Tell young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are so cheap.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the height of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business company.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were of plastic from <unk> from abroad.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could they survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for instance, creating gardens in the houses, and it's now working on the creation of the world's first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO -- work for government, but their history, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of the change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
They do business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and create a culture of business spirit -- is really a big step, but young people need the capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to use it in development and put their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources they need, to support the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and create real <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the spirit spirit is something that will start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park of <unk> this is how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the north state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not being on the way that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with view to a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of aluminum <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they had <unk> who thought I was going to clean up their <unk>
And that question kept with me, and I got a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where the <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> <unk> our crap.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked out of his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but he was still a <unk>
I needed more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in our trucks.
And <unk> the mechanical and <unk> <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you would get very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> waste is one of the ten <unk> most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and getting into traffic all day and they pass around you.
You just want <unk> so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall on the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is especially ironic because I believe the <unk> of waste is the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient form and effective every day, this starts <unk> from its containers and its dangers inherent in very real ways.
And so that we had <unk> for decades and centuries back back to <unk>
The economy needs.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the motor engines start to fail when it's endangered consumption is happening.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point up your relationship.
And then it's what I call our daily speed necessary.
And so I mean just the speed that we used to move used in the contemporary time.
We don't usually kill us, and we couldn't get it open, and we took ourselves to our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that would take away from it.
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste waste that maybe helps to reduce the stigma and <unk> them into that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to make our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us out of ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste garbage truck in the street, and I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing a paper paper like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I started to research the waste garbage and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe it was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and realize all the costs, even the very human cost of the work.
The <unk> waste we think about when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the nation in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, you will take a moment to <unk>
Let me take a moment to say thank you.
My work is to focus on the connection of thinking about our communal life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of a number of stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought about was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the skin of crystals generates heat inside the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it's about an temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And third, it looks like it has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I actually actually agreed with the old market that is the open air structure where thousands of people are going and they buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge is to study the site, which is located in a very much area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries from the building.
And this spreads with an <unk> <unk> which creates a space to open air into the building that would spread through its own form, of sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that will lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> concrete with <unk> to allow the air input and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we inspire us in these beautiful buttons of the dresses of the <unk>
They have fractal geometry and it helped me model the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> crystals that use the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what they did.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was actually going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to land there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city in which electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the early year, because we're going through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master master plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a very big project, the biggest I ever has designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I became special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation we did was expand the streets in existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell cell -- like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore natural ventilation.
So we made a framework that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that they set higher density on higher levels and lower density and lower density on the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community the occupied space for building construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and do activities such as a running race for two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's life changes communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have a target to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright hair, and a little <unk> little <unk> <unk> cute for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I got my sinister sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the school coming out of school. It was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took out of my teacher to my teacher grades.
And then I did.
I put up the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just some Like this.
All the Like this.  And I had to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other fellows had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put in all rows of <unk> and I have a row in a row -- just for being there, because I was going to go.
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got to me.
It was that it was all an obvious thing.
I never got stuck.
But above all, I was struck by the reason that I was bothered by that this little little girl -- so small to <unk>
I was passionate about jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also the primates. birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of child killings in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory where you study them in all the possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no grandfather's jealousy, there would be not literature.
You wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I put up the reading lists of high school -- because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> We have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, most of them have all of them.
This year, 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of the <unk> <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also in the ordinary <unk> mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were just as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> them.
It will be very obvious like the jealousy, that they cut to the person, to their desire, to your <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being the ideal and the audience, we know exactly what details I want to do, to <unk> the orange line, right?
<unk> make all of the <unk> <unk> and that's something I understood I understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure might give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself, that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- it adds up to his collection of instruments of instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You know, <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big piles of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful -- <unk> links to the language of jealousy.
When you <unk> it's on its fulfillment of jealousy, soon listening to the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's this scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search of knowledge, search of the truth, a painful truth, in fact, to what they <unk> the more painful the truth -- the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman to whom we need -- that makes us suffer, it causes a lot of more profound feelings and life that a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are telling us ourselves.
And there's some other excitement that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other emotion of us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Do you have any other excitement that teaches us to look with such <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was used by the idea that his wife was doing it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, that he didn't stand at what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he made his wife, without realizing that <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
<unk> really describe how <unk> make us look at intensity but no precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we have become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard over the news.
A <unk> Michigan <unk> was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook that would deliver horrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to interview the new girlfriend of her former <unk> I've got to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What's huge -- even though they fail, right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take you from your self and to convince you from what you ever do, and it's under the floor <unk> your name, takes your rings, your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good at social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head of <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs the <unk> genius -- it needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in the each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in <unk> <unk> once they <unk> <unk> all with their solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. It looks like this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems like dealing with them as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, we <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to stop the greatness in the other.
We can match it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have fiction to <unk>
It's just fiction to be the jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary one, Tom <unk> crazy <unk> Mr. Proust <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the module.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the dark gray gray was the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the largest deal of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked <unk> collaboration and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, from which <unk> came after Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that was 24 percent later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do you <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why is it <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why do I scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
It was because it was something great to be able to do that.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long practicing list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line from assembly and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they <unk> the <unk> and just eliminated smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 -- called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10, 10 went to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that problems that we imagined that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't give the <unk> tube <unk> from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that thing, it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days at TED.
It seems as if the technologists were <unk> and they had enriched with viral toys, things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that speed the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years to <unk> Intel and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically the incentives that venture capitalists offer to business.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused by the creation of ideas spread by the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly is going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were in their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred little investment by which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and developing capital is in the long term. They have never invested in developing technologies because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would take a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy as solar power -- wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is absolutely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of a <unk> energy -- a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control over the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we'll see an energy policy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they're not going to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in the food process.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affects <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things as harvest or systems for storage and <unk> food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was going to declared the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> to treatment, and only over the last 10 years seems to have been found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have to have -- but these four elements have been <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a problem of <unk> and we need to understand it.
The mission <unk> which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it meets those reports.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular science mythology like exploring the solar system.
Usually to go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a very large decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should have to regain trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And so I bow to think that there may be dropped in some other activities or institutions and that could have risen in others.
I don't have that.
But I can apply to opinion polls and polls of opinion are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago they continue to be pretty <unk> the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen on the street is almost exactly halfway back.
But is this evidence for enough?
What the record polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you do?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people do: when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if anybody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
I probably would say to ask, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very scary answer.
And you might say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put the confidence in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel by a certain kind of official or official or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all of them.
I could, for instance, to say I trust an elementary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school type.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my wildest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more unequal way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real, because they try to solve the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what's <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> of not trusting what you're not reliable.
And I think that those people who were holding their savings with very <unk> named Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you tell it, he says, yes, OK, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in commodities -- and it's responsible and responsible then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they are not aware we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't think about them to take a letter to the email because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it is, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> to find out before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that we made us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the amount of <unk> that I will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in our entire public life, and we think that the accountability system is destined to ensure <unk> and testing tests in reality is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> as we say.
Now you know all of you have similar examples.
We put all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different than if you stop being worthy of trust, and we give them to the people who are reliable and whether to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the simple actions -- the simple actions -- which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should have to rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's signature because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give enough bases to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to contribute evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, what the common people, the <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- says I can <unk> without giving any explanations for.
I take them back and get the money, or they change them by the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson at that.
If you come vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to do.
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early early computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the digital information, the <unk> between our material world, and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly gone and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started to imagine how we <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, they break the barriers.
But the two hands stay still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of hands?
In the link of Sciences of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a small space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area.
<unk> a plastic bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, reach inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, which is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and try to make lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down from every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we will be <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device in your head or <unk> when the system is understanding your geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make it physicists so we can make it physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel of it.
This imam magnet is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that so much the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did is we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and then <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And when we program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and will be able to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and a distance and the famous round of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality, sometimes you want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but start to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us as a part of the physical world around us.
We started the talk today by talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was terrified to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to invite a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After they survive the Islamic Revolution, they believe firmly that there was just a way to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer to be an opera movie.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer got to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of school and the host of a radio show.
But to no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
I think that for the rest of my life a second class of second class to be the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one on me wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> My name's <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not a <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this trap. It is <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave place to my reading <unk>
We have a lot of perspectives.
For instance, at first this map I thought it was out of place, because this is what students in China learn.
I would never have happened that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields as comparative religion.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading work worked for research, why not do it as well in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
You can be <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are social, political and spiritual goods.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of missing in the translation, I found that you can make a lot of her.
For instance, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel that I used to feel or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that it's not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always were <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman, called <unk>
So Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch in my office and took off the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My fellow <unk> had a <unk> like the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do this.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought up the <unk> it became easy to just move my head while it comes to the solution.
<unk> is the new <unk> said Alex, and so I looked like, she was right.
You start working later on, then you have kids home later, even though death goes on.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But soon after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to push me to Alex I would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with the guy underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was going to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> with the next.
Moreover, the best time to work in same-sex marriage is before he <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but it didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of benign Herbie was a real problem and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and her loving life, but for race families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without passing before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yeah! Okay, they're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream off a <unk> I want to see. It's good.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of moments that shape her life will have happened to have 30 and <unk>
People in the '40s, I don't coached panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know more than half of the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future couple to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any point in life and we know that the female fertility reaches its top to the 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the moment to tell you about their body and their options.
When we think about development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person that <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence.
<unk> would tell you, <unk> names to the <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> to a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the urgency of urgency and her ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, smart <unk> like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship -- I'm not just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a race before the 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, and they <unk> but then at some point about the '30s, turned out the music and everyone started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, pick a choice -- pick a couple, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful <unk> to do all of the <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
Like it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living <unk> very hard, his previous life was even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she would raise her same when she says, "You don't choose your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well, a day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire time.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning I was standing with his whole lot of contacts, but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> please <unk> <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give me <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade of Emma passed ahead.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said Emma three things that all <unk> or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> from that identity of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of the work, but I know this: identity of identity generates of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to go.
I'm not <unk> exploration, <unk> exploration, I mean, by the way, it's not exploration, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said Emma would explore jobs and to make them count.
Second, I told Emma the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, how you know, how you know, how do you talk, how do you talk, and where do they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from their closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from their friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the <unk> jobs was never <unk> then, meeting the head of your neighbor is the way we get a job that was not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
At the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but to her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when she has a partner and it is her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit in my head or even the 25 or I agree with you.
But to choose the person you live now, or you can tell you when all on Facebook are starting to walk into <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what is what you want instead of just doing it work or kill time with anyone who is <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the New roommate in a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond was helped to get a job there.
That work supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, who I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and I sent to a letter to send me a letter that said, "Now the room of emergency contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out from the airport in Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
Similarly, in the same way, to 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good pause -- a good TED Talk can have enormous effects over the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
That's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> and use their holes, use their holes, you choose your family.
They don't let people define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City public schools.
And as any of any professor, I applied tests and tests.
I give you assignments.
When the work would come, they spread grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure otherwise much better.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what to <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would expect, as far as possible in competition.
We studied very hard teachers working in neighborhoods really hard, and what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking ourselves, what about these sellers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came up with a feature as a critical <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look like physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only a week, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not at the same speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly more likely to <unk> even when we put them in every single feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security of the evidence that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little that we know about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop the determination in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a organize ethic of work?
How do I keep them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't follow with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the reverse determination is not related to whether or related to the talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain, and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when you get older, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to try and fail, to begin everything back to the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the beauty and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was rewarded for this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy at all.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, long enough to read <unk> <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to go for a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, like I was shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors on the old west <unk>
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
These are building blocks for many more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are a crowd.
If one person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a dilemma, such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of recall, because a loudspeaker is pretty an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> a guy at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they care is <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every single effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire.
We know that Japan is the Earth's sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is to China.
So a sun along the beginning, create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
And today, the caterpillar has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a output.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
And the film has been his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and lead a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live in and we raise our children in a kind of a complex industrial <unk> program.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took past 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a little bit of metal and a <unk> boy would send a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a lot of difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of the Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician in <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
It was magic shoes to defeat the armies in the computer of evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of the Oz is that the most unhealthy characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did Star Trek to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son at the time.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  So she slid into the room and was struck as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke have an army for overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the magician with the magician of <unk>
How do he make Dorothy your film?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, okay? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there that so much efficient capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There is a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I really expected the credits to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal -- and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, to defend from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war
Of course, the most successful topic of all times is still appearing in classic after classic each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who are raising a child.
Until many of you are thinking about this year, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let you get the <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test for <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the middle of the '80s, I recorded a conversation I'd had with a friend about the assessment of the movies they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there is more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something else from the boy than <unk>  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> movie <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of consensus about what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test test.
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the hostage.
We have lots of scenes of men who have profound and painful and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Get the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's focus on the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 popular films, how many of them think they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then is okay.
But there's a larger number than this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said.
One in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think it is the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're tracking that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to do it.
We have tools to our willingness to be <unk> <unk> and we hope that to be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of box, is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that you care about home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was her favorite favorite character of "Star <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are you in common about these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress there.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to say to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where you see his work is join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician in <unk>
Thank you.
I was living in Maine in Maine and one of the things I liked was looking for the sea <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
But over time, I was terrified to <unk>
I started to see patterns and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my sea <unk> had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place in the East <unk> in Egypt called <unk>
And the point in simple eye seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we have used the satellite data to find an old city, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of old art and the architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge continuous <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about about <unk> for <unk> kilometers.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA NASA to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, look for layers of human occupation for it.
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that comes back from the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found work of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but let's go back to the place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle East, probably was written in <unk> four years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas really have started in 1984 C. <unk> in a lost city not for a long time, and found from the high.
It certainly puts the <unk> search in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the <unk> door.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that is made.
Now we had a group of <unk> obese cars.
They are competing in a car <unk> and they go in the direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, are <unk>
And they collide in front of the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that go on the side of the wheels that ends up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the gate, <unk>
So the <unk> in the hall, or whatever the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
And on a brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> making them on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go down to get into the mouth.
He ran on the side and <unk> her living room.
So in the room, and making use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes and dancing over its core, singing <unk> A <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The floor has been coated with a yellow <unk> path, and from the oven. They come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
They took whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize very quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best memories <unk>
I asked him, "You know, when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have been trained to perform these miraculous miraculous acts using ancient techniques invented two billion years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their speakers, and the medieval <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant one, although a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of video <unk> live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
So you have to start with something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending the bulk of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's impressive.
Someone would be incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We traveled a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a lot of treaties on the memory of the writing about something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory was not such a rare thing as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we have changed.
We have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed more <unk>
We have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a research group from University College London invited a bunch of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're even more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
And there was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the <unk> subjects with <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine. They <unk> their brains as they were <unk> the faces and <unk> forms of snow, they found that on memory champions and different parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of the <unk> <unk> is dealing with a armed race where each year comes into a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about trying to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the right order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques at the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It comes in with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> he says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
What do you say?
The person who said to her name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who told her work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship relationship.
With all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
It would be good when they come back home to work.
You probably had some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back half a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> I attended a <unk>
They were hired as a entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring it to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up there, he <unk> her memory poem and he <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let's go to everyone.
But not only did it kill everyone, but they ripped the bodies out of it.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, and he closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every here.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where his loved ones were on the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we are not good at remembering names, or or numbers of the <unk> or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you ask them to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse radio <unk> in their lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and image images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy idea, you know, <unk> <unk> and <unk> the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that I would have done it, if you had invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're in the door of your house.
And I come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous image, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and see the <unk> of <unk> mounted on <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that bizarre journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their speakers, not word for word, that it's going to be confused by typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase "In first <unk> it would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got myself full of that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting around taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that's happening is when somebody else <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was entertaining.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about to do is better enhance the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my job of training for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some fake security recorders leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a truck of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could be able to put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone phone numbers, and actually this is not the point.
These are just so many tricks. They work that they work.
Because it's based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to put it into the memory of memory or memorize them from <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basics, we remember when we pay attention.
So let's focus on it deeply when we focus on it.
The palace, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of a complete attention that most of them is not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are doing <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what you <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human face in front of us, who will walk into our side to be so <unk> that we don't even think about it in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we will just get a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am <unk> Jersey, I was six and lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that was giving the living room.
And there you all spent my time watching television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I got married, and I was wrapped up in a towel all of me.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> unsure and hated it.
<unk> that tour, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not from areas of areas, but of those <unk> emotional connections, that we feel in the places that <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot of that.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
And this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you ask you, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it because it's based on a building building for the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways that we built our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
You see, these stable <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people that <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public <unk> <unk> which was completed in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this round of this thing, has this round of red columns -- the red columns -- that they leave <unk> about communicating with this <unk> children, the values of ownership, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was completed by another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media of communication in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new new solutions to the current forms of life.
We were blessed and we gave ourselves so much, that we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead in the inside because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we just start to experience <unk> we do now swing the back back to go by, over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I took over the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
It's really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
I put the next one back in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turn them into skyscrapers -- that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> by the French or the Italian.
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and started doing <unk> <unk> again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques that we have on a computer, and we find ourselves with new <unk> in some ways that are attached to other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> it's totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> again in opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, the entire building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when she critics and public <unk> they were completely agree about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao increased a half thousand percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and he Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction to these forms.
They did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the early millennials happened to another star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these very few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of consumption of information.
Think of it, for example, how use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, all of us are photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast as possible.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before I knew if I designed four years ago was successful or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, <unk> because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the <unk> of steel or the elevator.
My theory is that when the self is applying to media, starts to swing faster and faster, until you get on both extremes almost in <unk> and it actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge, something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes fun with collective memory, and by taking these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think of architecture, because digital media haven't only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to search for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words that are using words and drawings -- and one is no longer a <unk> audience who doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> from one style to another one, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what was a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we're finally going to be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage parking in Miami can also serve for a sport or to <unk> or you can even get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> East -- and raise half a million dollars from the community together around that cause, no longer is a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
No matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not in opposite sides there.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not only reflected in our society, but they give them a way to more <unk> the local libraries the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step back to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and it started walking.
And it does this really cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
You laugh and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And I thought to think, When do I do this?
How is it that we suddenly don't taste with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, he only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though her mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Between what his mom tells you and what his friends, or fellow school people say, he doesn't know who they believe.
So he does a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and begs others you please leave a <unk> "I'm a nice or I'm <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a regular and regular teenager, who receives these answers to one of their most emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking to you: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continued way, so young young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what's rigged digitally.
What is the best one in the life of someone who is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the <unk>
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people you?
But kids are not immune to this.
It was like the including superheroes of sport, and the singers were <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in an obsessed culture in the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, developing their physical skills, their studies and other aspects they start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they're not nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as <unk> society and labor development field.
<unk> percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom class to participate in the classroom of classroom because they don't want to call your attention for their physical shape.
One in five are not attending at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the sports season, if you don't think you see you good, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently <unk> <unk> a lower note to the average of your peers who don't care about that as appearance.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it turns out independently of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be clear, we are talking about how you see you just not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they are not healthy that they can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around us, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drug consumption, <unk> surgery, <unk> sexual activity, and without protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, again, regardless of whether or not they have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't show up to an interview interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would that happen?
<unk> this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill trust in its own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we should make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus in six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relations.
These six aspects of them are <unk> points for anyone to provide a body self-worth that works.
One is a fundamental education, but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the current status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you see them.
We can all start by doing that by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies like companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow up to valuing their whole person to valuing their own diversity, valuing <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
And so let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think you see that they are never <unk> to be who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who is in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk> his <unk>
It could be just the woman who is two minutes away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, that he was told by not having long legs -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we put it out of it, and we need to save your potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk>
But let's go to our children the truth.
I think the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because of how they make us feel.
I went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> in a year age today, becoming safe <unk> agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the fifth of November 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk> <unk>
At the end, they were initially innocent, but being a prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and based on the United Nations.
So, luckily, those plans will spread by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb, in the World Trade Center, couldn't be able to escape it.
Later <unk> would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving mother, elementary school school by the two they did everything that you could for giving me happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want to want to wish to the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media so that everybody lived as them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last week of week, he and some friends, had been going to training training at Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on his shoulder, and explained to me how to point to the goal for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shot him to the little orange light on the goal and to surprise everybody, especially by me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a kid.
All of all, the comment had a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they found that funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a van loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, and causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood, I was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable near someone was time to pack up and go to another city.
As I was always the face of the class and often was a <unk> victim.
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white man, but to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on home reading books, watching television or playing games.
For these reasons they did not develop social skills to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was invited by opera to judge people, based on indicators -- like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test my way to think, was during election presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I participated in at the <unk> National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who we had made in Norway was a Jewish one.
It took several days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to defeat the barrier that all of life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in the development of my character.
Every life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish I wanted to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is about being homosexual but I know what is going to be trial for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation -- they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a time I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my own life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that would hold on my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with your eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough of endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hate inside the time.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my father's relationship and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put myself in an possible.
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone is going to be able to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path -- which even though I was terrified to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do this by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism I speak against those acts of meaningless acts as rejection of my father.
And with this simplicity I put myself up here as a test that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that the children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your neighbor, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood time that you project into your eyes.
And there's constantly a voice superimposed on your collective thinking stream.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film to yourself, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I don't doubt that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why aren't we just robots that we get to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, it's objective to build it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective is subjective it.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, it will make that vision.
Science studied <unk> behavior, neuroscience was studying the brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> it's the moment for science to be <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, -- a flowering of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of science science in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations for it.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they do with what they are.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> Why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a movie internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the <unk>
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon as <unk> as <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do they operate the <unk> how they work -- how they work -- they adapt to how they adapt and <unk> the living organisms, all of them are questions about the target.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some of the behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk to how we talk to them, how we talk to them, they all are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all the behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit me against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful explanations chain. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains biology, biology explaining part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know we know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the visual subjective film includes sort of an illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the <unk> the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and so many others, that vision is quite close close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying as the observation of consciousness is satisfying as the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
And physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the core <unk> space, space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties do not explain in terms of nothing else.
Instead, they consider fundamental principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the key list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts -- time, mass, laws of Newton. And then <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- time -- time -- mass, charge, then for a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing that would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness to other fundamental concepts -- space, the mass, the mass processes.
And physicists sometimes say we want to do fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> all over the mind, and every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when you think about "Oh, I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some raw feeling, which is a primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, it's natural assume that it can also be universal.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
One more profound reason it comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there's information processing -- there's a consciousness.
<unk> <unk> as complex as in a human being, <unk>
<unk> of simple information, <unk>
And a very exciting thing is that in recent years a <unk> neuroscientist, I took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of information, of information, as much significant, degree of consciousness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, you know, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high level of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From the <unk> view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically, describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical consequences.
Some may be <unk>
I used to think she shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, so I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing -- so that the answer is yes, if you are conscious.
If this is right, you can have a very serious ethical problem about the ethic of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group as the audience in a TED Talk -- at this moment we have a human collective consciousness, a internal film to this whole set of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm really sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental than the second one, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those pieces of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will be able to figure out what we're going to be able to find out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
It had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I went to my friends, with my friends, my friends, with my younger sisters.
It was all normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted <unk> for a community Prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother's <unk> and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yes. How a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching school in a high school of <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> I got a kid up and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When the people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> room.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experience with disabled people as physical objects.
And we are not. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I am on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to do it." Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and can't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because we would give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, I would encourage the disabled people who have no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that one person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been tackled <unk> I will express that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability against people with not disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
So let's look at some things.
But the things we overcome is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more <unk> because of the society that we live in, because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
It makes the things that I need you to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those photos as well.
They're not doing anything out of common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this one that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
It comes from other people with disability right now.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  You know, <unk> the clever trick of how you would charge the mobile phone trick on the battery battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance from others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that the lie that they have been selling us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a leg has not ever done it becomes a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen will not make the subtitles <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be <unk> by the ground and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade school in a school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you know about what you do is what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of reality <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing is the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would love with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 pounds man will tell us, trying to match everything to be.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> practices because the idea of <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
So a moment. Let's get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in a soccer field, from the perspective of <unk>
You might have noticed that lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice -- mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many already know about.
The Great <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why why, with this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my God! Ah! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
Which will be their experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when I store them, and owners see the information about what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore was put a <unk> to her field <unk> to play the faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to be <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> made radio in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to their group, and you see your next move that you showed you in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about being <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They're just coming out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just an <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people that are below.
You can get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that is already working.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will get <unk>
This is going to take the good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for Americans.
It's also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine you're the <unk>
They took the ball and <unk>
He <unk> a <unk> All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight is <unk> you know, a defense behind you is going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the system of <unk> will <unk>
It comes to the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open cord.
<unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we can land, but the receptor looks at its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> runs <unk>
The audience <unk> and the fans have followed them from every angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to do a lot of people, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
You want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally going to be somewhere else.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions is from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it a <unk> or a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about the space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face is <unk> as usual of us.
Thank you.
I was recently, after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years later, I spent the <unk> the southern end of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden <unk> was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is no practical and no practical <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that the decline from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits about about 120 miles an hour.
<unk> impact turns out bones, some of which will give vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that not, they usually go into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize <unk> death than <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they get their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darkest moment, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a official looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 of July last year when I got a call from a possible suicide subject sitting in the fence near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to Jason talking to an official Bridge <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try and suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the history of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind kind and intelligent guy in New Jersey had just taken your life.
I talked to the fathers of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had <unk>
<unk> damage of suicide is affecting a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody would loved <unk>
What do you say?
What does it say?
In my experience, we don't just have to speak, but you need to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell you the person you know how it feels like because you probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: Do you think about the similar circumstances have thought about finishing up your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social social <unk> and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with her permission and I blessing I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go to the bridge this week.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but knowing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> game.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and told me that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk down the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied a radio call by a possible suicide company, on the sidewalk sidewalk near the northern tower.
I took my <unk> on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, he ends up immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for her account to come back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin was turned on, I was <unk>
"This is a new new life."
But I asked him, "What was what made you <unk> and gave birth to hope and life was <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> I didn't erase the events of 11 March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I believe that Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thanks to God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We take God thanks to you.
I do not do in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited General General in San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I thought I did have it to be <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
Talk about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story is inspired by others.
suicide is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, theft is theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt somebody else.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls of suicide around the bridge.
In those incidents that I've been directly involved in -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And during that time, I would love her hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact the bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people have jumped from the bridge, and they lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second they leave the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should use to work for doing.
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior, you know what you are, and a question tells you, how do you get involved in that?
I have to be something that is unique in that sense, but I'm not alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had from a child.
My outside of the outside of my inner truth, with my inner self.
So for the reasons, what I'm going to refer to me later, when I look at this picture, and I'm thinking, you know, you got it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all loved our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations we imposed on the color of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> as I was born because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wear this shirt on my head.
And my mom said, "Why are you always wearing that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to do it?"
The gender has always considered a <unk> but we now know that, really, is something more complex and mystery here.
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because I thought that being a bad thing, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mom, Dad and a family who took me up as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
And I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something struck me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was responsible for the <unk> and <unk> and that night, and that night, I won on a bathroom suit, I won a <unk> suit, and she was just third <unk> between over 40 shots.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was Queen of beauty of women's <unk> but I can can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied by when I took myself in Thailand to 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who was living in his own truth, but that, <unk> made her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 November, we make a global <unk> for the <unk> Day of <unk>
I'm in this stage thanks to a long history of people who are <unk> and stood up by injustice.
These are Helen P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth, without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.   <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Oh, <unk> first, thank you to thank all of my <unk>
My parents to my parents especially, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, he would call my mom and he would call my mom and say, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other people don't. It's just gender identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that assignment, not a block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to come, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, to the parents are generally known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending her rights in 2007. And when his efforts were awarded in 2011, to <unk> the National Prize <unk> was made very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I took a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality and the exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when you're born a girl, your birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome or their father or his mother.
And the neighborhood comes from, gives her <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot about having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the real mother, but the daughter, <unk> daughter, <unk> when it grows, he suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and school back to her siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move down the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into the adolescence, when it goes into 13 years, he reads him out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the honor of her father and her brothers and her brothers and her family, and if you were trying to get the code of that honor of that thing, honor, it could even kill themselves.
And it's interesting that this assumption code -- it doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of her life and happiness of her sisters in the name of course of honor.
And there's a norm more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's not supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
That's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of her father and their mother and the decisions of the <unk> even if they don't want.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with a old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> her daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this cycle cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought of his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter, so for her.
But when I was shocked, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half and a half and a half and a half years old in my school.
Now you might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I need to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in hunter-gatherer societies in tribal societies -- it's a great event for life as a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations and the aspirations that it can explore its potential for your future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of a <unk> Canadian and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, to forget the lesson of <unk>
He taught the students to forget the lesson of called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, advocate for more rights to women, and they were going to get more and more room for women in society.
But we find a new phenomena.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of the involvement of women in all political activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> teenage girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to get around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, <unk> stood up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper on the BBC, he was offered to her same for the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the nine of October 2012, he was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read her to my wife and "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please do not <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
They raise your life for the cause of truth for the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter inspired you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words we spend a lot for me, and I didn't ask you again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was broken through my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to get good. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl in <unk>
<unk> when you don't have his homework.
They fight your siblings, and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me, "What is special about my mentoring that has done so bold to <unk> so bold and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I read what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you I've recently joined up with the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> But all the work that I'm talking about today about brain science, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get into a brain cell.
You're still just as smart or not?
If you're not going to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try and keep them alive.
More than I've been saved by a bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would try to get the dose of <unk> because there is really no clear map to say it in <unk>
I started testing a different mix with different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small small changes in the dose would dramatically be my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I had a dose and chemical dose for a man of 1900s, and I was surprised by looking at how I <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of them.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that I had the front, and it just won't.
So I couldn't do it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do, since then I've got myself better with men.
What I was trying to do is that I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thought, my creative thinking -- my ideas of ideas.
I think about thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my key perspective, how do you get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were going to build new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things differently.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I can find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental imagery quickly mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're quite close to getting this with two recent experiments that did for two groups that have been done by two groups leading in neuroscience.
And they both used interactive technology and functional resonance imaging to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The backbone of the brain shows the brain scan of that same individual while you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost fat.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is pretty high.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into the visual fields of <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains are <unk> to create a big pool of reactions in the brain before the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain brain information, you can show it to show what the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us.
We're pretty close to doing that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems of higher resolution systems, today, and its resolution a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and put electrodes.
I don't offer myself for that.
Many of them are proposing new techniques to projection by images, even I believe with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask ourselves the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but to this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution -- doesn't increase for thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI is to make really large, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and receptors in the MRI system.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field of magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic field.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of surface processing patterns, we can increase <unk> the information that can be extracted in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split up our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of <unk> but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our thinking of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices than open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll tell you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her kitchen might be telling some person for the first time that she loves her or tell someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation for which you have ever done through life.
I think it's a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like to happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of intensity on <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I would be <unk> by the <unk> of my pants and I have <unk> my head -- I just asked me a little kid, "Hey, are you a kid or <unk>
And there'd be awkward silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a full of <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother dropped a cold look at her son.
But I would not say anything, and I put it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence but this time I was prepared and I was about to go on with the female issues at the table.  I had quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a shard of the "Vagina Monologues," <unk>
So I took a deep look at it and I went down and my backs, and my backs, a little kid with a little dress in me, who is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you <unk>
So I took a deeper back again, and I put myself out of him, and I said, "Hey, do I know this is confusing.
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and you see a child, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a dress and pink and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me and she was paying attention, and he said, "My favorite skin is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all right, just "Oh, OK. You are a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color walls.
You only know how one feels like living in a closet.
It's like my pasta not different or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared online banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder to tell your five-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the tough thing.
We have to stop classifying what it is difficult for us to do with the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live in something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel secure, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse for a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't a militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years that would fit in the coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, it was going on in a corner of my dark closet.
My family, my whole strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable authorities, was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of them were invited to know it was gay, and when I did my <unk> <unk> of honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were friends of my parents, people who knew me about years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women I screamed for Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it is <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our classic Will and Grace show.
And you know who we have <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to speak desperately their support, to let me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband was wearing an <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you are.
It's just like the tough conversations are still my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep doing what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of the way is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had <unk> but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know.
If you say to your parents that maybe be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be bothered by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> by what they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark kitchen <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very lonely, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence has seen an intelligence that's productive has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that the question of if a machine can think about it is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's go back a walk.
Let's first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason it would be we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that there is no concept of the Earth on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to some point in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be fixed very accurately in the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that will increase the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to do complex stuff.
And so, taking all these different issues and <unk> together, he said, <unk> -- there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence we can get from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence I ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keeping the choices open up with a T, that with the diversity of potential future accessible, but to an impending time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
History tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep the alternative choices.
And so if you realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence, a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior are not only correlated in the production of the long term, but actually directly directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy for the long term that you can find in.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence, play games, and even make money out of it, all of them without having to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
As a human foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave <unk> a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for the humanoid robotics and the human patient technologies.
This ability for tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, the same as some other animals can cooperate as opposed to a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we look at <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to succeed the network well.
This same capacity grid capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, finding out successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand worldwide in the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> <unk> to successfully increase the assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have tremendous applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you have seen is that a variety of brands of smart cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation -- all of us derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you have smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion that would be <unk>
The machines fit against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion, <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart, and then they try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take the control of all the future potential is a fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence, that intelligence can actually come directly from taking control instead of being upside down.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
I often ask me, how do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoiding the future freedom of action and avoiding the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last few years, we have expanded so much our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA Kepler has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space Telescope.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and its stem star.
In the together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that get from their suns.
Instead, this gives us clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The <unk> year was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for millennia now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale has rapidly shifted our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a scientist scientist and the weather, and I'm not <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe, where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I'm looking for aliens in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the early planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, you can be considered a potentially livable world.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past and, in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface to search clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now offer not just short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are actually <unk> with Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the air is cool and filled with oxygen filled by our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets <unk> with a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars is waiting for save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
So I want to like exploration exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to honor humanity to humanity is as figuring out the captain of Titanic will tell us that the party of truth will be more late in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for exploration exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked her, realizing that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to continue between the stars, lose the notion of the important thing that we can protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's <unk> to think that only colonization <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see by the window that were at the dining table, where it had been <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all closed off.
I thought I call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had flight early to Europe to Europe next morning, and I would take my passport and my bag.
It was expensive, but you certainly don't even more expensive than a <unk> at the middle night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was going to be over.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases heart rhythm, and the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which would make a bad thing.
Or at least if bad things happen, you know, the probability of it that is a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were born.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who's won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I'd been practicing something called hindsight retrospective
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and tries to figure out what was wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the <unk>
In the house, you get a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk> works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the animals are, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the <unk> tribes live where those tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets you find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they <unk> the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move so much.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car <unk> glasses of reading and <unk>
So at home, you would take a place for the keys, a hook to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport a particular drawer in it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it, your things will always be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit, licensed cards, and I stopped by email them to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one to be dear, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of us making medical decisions and actually for social decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we have to take from that would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart stroke.
So you're thinking that you have high cholesterol that is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most physicians don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you should think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's a fault.
We didn't really understand the mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the killer researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, brain stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more, and it is, <unk> from the effects of <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things -- <unk> muscle pain.
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how we do this with the time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug that will help you the drug.
I don't say they should or don't say <unk>
I just say that they must have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical ethic matters is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the crash value of the crash, but actually this number needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men of 50, <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to try is <unk>
That's about 49 surgeries per person who has been <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can make that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but unless you have trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn off a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react quickly. They could be the lunch lunch -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational, as Danny <unk> and your colleagues have ever shown.
So we have to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be able to be able to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor gave myself a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of entry in the same way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered them, and lots of text messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be <unk> at a full silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the children's American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs of the French signs came over in the 1800s, and over the time of time, they mixed with local signs and developed the language we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following blindly their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do I understand the sound of it?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how old people are.
So I've learned, for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> I covered them in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> in our decide.
They're going to be able to keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent of sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, I'll make it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the tendency and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my field of art.
Is it going to be more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that so well that they are not only through the ears.
I can feel <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and sound property in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was stuck with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell it to me.
I chose to get stuck.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value on something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to focus on the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can say of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning of the signals as much as of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in many different parameters, different <unk>
If you map a different <unk> for every finger as the piano, the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so as the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it comes to the piano, the English is a linear language.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If you only would change the sheet, it would create a completely different meaning,
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal would be involved in that."
This is the sign of the <unk> on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For instance, this is the <unk> sign of the sun is coming out and you're wearing.
This is all day."
If you put it down, and you get the speed, visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to say <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what the time is expressed in <unk> and how distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a term term with a <unk> rate of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> hand <unk> <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of my hands on top.
Now we're going to do so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this: Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they pass very differently.
It's amazing to see how <unk> live and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound, automatically has no social value.
We need to start to question what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not to learn to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove trove of trove I'd like you had the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and to experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say to me, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence, or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that the adults also <unk> and that they're not really good to clean the ones from others.
The time, I am now adult and I teach citizenship and invention in school school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk down the beach <unk> with lots of waste.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this <unk> working work for the kids that are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electric tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children were getting a lot with robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we build light lamps and web cameras and put it in a floating robot, which is moving up with the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic constantly floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this step back on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would tell you even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local and local problem, they're trying to solve it immediately.
I also research my own problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get stuck with this image: you know?
A child, maybe smaller than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, only using the hands of the hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> world.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown <unk> and when everything comes out, it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that make <unk> different <unk> which can help you identify what there is in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can see a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away or maybe address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant to the water.
And today, according to the average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific.
Today, all the Pacific Pacific has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast and the majority of the time, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> parents didn't get it.
But every night you go to the center of <unk> you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take a serious job, but they did do it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> their whole life.
Along with them, we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an Indian expedition the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a thousand miles of the nuclear center, and with the <unk> aid of the zone we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a sediment of sediment as we invented and built it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to the social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood and metal <unk> a little bit of biology, basically, you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in movement in the age of old age transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles.
The plastic and oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So that, citizen scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two completely opposite of design.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces the other one of a silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one would believe it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was a tool of Michelangelo.
But the living ones are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information needed for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects and trained to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You acts primarily like filter -- the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that is also very much its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen, which represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect at work currently between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the organism, between the assembly and the organism between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right hemisphere shows in both screens after me.
My job in the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving out of the assembly and going to growth.
You probably ask why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare, moment, where four disciplines offer designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> scope to a <unk> base that one day not very far away to print <unk> and graphics and <unk> facts that glow in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> only to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion fashion for Paris -- they're going <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in <unk> <unk> around the waist.
Along with the collaborator of 3D printing -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> with the cells.
This helmet is <unk> and rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution and <unk> instruments that allow them to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair and comfortable <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
The <unk> teacher, my collaborator, went back to nature for <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> <unk> becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts of nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what it matters.
Like her <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between trunk, and branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow up with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design if the objects were made of a single part?
Tell a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material that we have the kind of material in the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second amount of <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of tons of tons -- are produced every year by organisms as shrimp, and crabs and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their property, we could generate <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal.  <unk> a bunch of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures at a big scale, there was a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material that's three to three <unk>
When the pieces are ready, it allows them to dry it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process they used to contain <unk> <unk> who showed up for the first time on the planet three billion years ago.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of color <unk> and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to <unk> <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and put it on the ground, they'll grow up a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the ability to create clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just as instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological disorders within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We set up our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops by <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two hypotheses don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the telltale tract that is going to help you build these bacteria and to <unk> their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more to <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This solar system <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it spans 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our little gut intestine
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> bright channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are creatures, <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if the design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we were able to create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, we would save the wild tissue and destroy our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For it, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is <unk> material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in which it was <unk>
The manufacturing isn't going to be on this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or <unk> <unk> those fibers each other.
And this happens across scales.
<unk> worm first <unk> in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, play in a single material.
In order to better understand how this complex process works, we glue a small magnet to the head of a worm worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of <unk>
However, when you place the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts and different parts -- and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms were often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk>
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the pure silk <unk> one single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we built this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to darker areas and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat it to it -- to make silk <unk>
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to marry us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they got <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk -- they give all this pavilion and their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk by a robotic arm, the other full of empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a two material ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can get your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and art and performing websites -- playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, to have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, gets to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was excited about something else, something totally different, and I would focus on it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me because of nothing.
I was worried about being afraid to commitment, or being cleared or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you then.
<unk> themselves, where you learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned from culture.
You ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers to kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again as we grow a lot of different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the beautiful exercise before what you take away from sleep.
Why?
Now, while this question is inspired by children to dream, what they might be, don't inspire to dream, with everything that might be.
In fact, it does right on the contrary, because when somebody asks you to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though well-intentioned adults would be <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this John <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that look at curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for somebody in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
Could it help you in three parts of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
I want to make any term that you like or <unk> your own one.
It seems to me as sort of to adapt to a community, we can't agree with one single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths by being in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests at cartography, visualization of data, travel, math and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mix and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
From there the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When we <unk> we become <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been <unk> in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to each new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full of time and <unk>
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they started their practices, and this ability to write it so compelling that for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to have a loss of time to do what you want, even if at the end of it.
You can apply that knowledge into a completely different field, a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower superpower <unk> is adaptability. That is the ability to transform anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the CEO of videos, which is a website, sometimes conferences, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it's a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take a lot more valuable depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas and quick learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk>
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> off the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put together ideas and <unk> and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that will be involved with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once he said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with the internal wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist -- then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman called <unk> they led to a psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing is even more amazing.
If I had been living in this room today, we couldn't give her more aid than the fact that he <unk> gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have found antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, free to HIV, for <unk> and much more.
But recently, it's made progress in treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's is almost one in two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend your years with Alzheimer's or helping care for a friend or wanting to take care of Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of the five dollars of healthcare is spend at Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease, and their costs will increase a <unk> increase in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you cannot <unk> cure or even slow their development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research, despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time you know, but the whole world Alzheimer's world Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, the scientists, disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable of aging.
But you can only look at a picture of a healthy brain as compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory of memory and abilities, damage to Alzheimer's brain caused by Alzheimer's -- significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of molecules of protein.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that's folds up like origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these points <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what happened to block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
It took a wire you could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we <unk> and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, in his most part, they have <unk> the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this way to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our own results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other inside them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to bet that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden <unk> of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most of the genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
I want to talk about them, and you help demand a cure.
Thank you.
And we had this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
In love to do this.
The article about a psychological study is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when I tested myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers would be <unk> to get done for 36 questions more and more personal and then both look at the eyes without talking about for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When did the last time you go to someone else's person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner and what you like from him or her -- I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study, a few years ago, a really really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to hear them.
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent them to the column, and so many months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask, keep it together yet.
And the reason I think they challenge this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had invited me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that cost a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I did, I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and then Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic traffic.
And the Sunday already had called the Show <unk> and the Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the paper got over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with sure -- about your own experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been news news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: They still go together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And several messages come up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put it around.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers to test the study in these different kinds of success.
So my first impulse to this whole attention was very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did for the public study together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders for photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming a fear of <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know whether it really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce <unk> love -- not only one adventure, but <unk> <unk> love.
But this was a question I couldn't respond.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, especially -- that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing that, several later studies, also used the protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a rapid form of creating trust and interaction among strangers.
They've been used between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people from the <unk> <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, and that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to tell you that you get from the person who you do it.
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but they got better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29, I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was almost pretty much my adulthood, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went into science.
And what I was able to find out all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could somehow be <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just did for the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was distracted by the romantic love of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used to me as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably I can demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is an academic, not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It can be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to be able to mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very scary story, because in love you can feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask us to ask questions questions like, like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily necessarily answer the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year, a known time, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love -- it's not the same thing to stay <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. Love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times we would have both of them to make that decision, and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want you enough to have done and responded -- 36 questions, have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think of it.
And what you do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian in full mountain and in a way, I was like a <unk> of the forest.
One of the city of New York ago, a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and you put a dollar note, a pen and a tuning in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the weird <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has funny because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
And at a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going to go from a field and <unk> and all of those things happened and I was making a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, the <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin at the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, something happened. In some way it looked like it increased size, as if it was that they <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, and these strange bottles of bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to figure out, and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow around, draw them just like you do about a <unk> <unk>
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, you can make an idea.
And then I did insects and social creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning a little bit of money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was a great man.
At some point I became interested in the human way, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on glass layers, similar to a window on a window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work will come up with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 thousand pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It's double a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They're going from the world of representation, on this <unk> <unk> <unk> where you get <unk>
This is where the creatures with the heads of animals are headed by <unk> lists for suicide in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
So, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand comes out. clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It has a 5.5 feet <unk> a tail of snake <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn on fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Their tail ends up on a <unk> eye <unk> made out of terrorist cards.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each of us is a archive of our culture, through media and material or <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's taken years old.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can <unk> the door.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there is a waterfall that goes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or whatever it is that he has -- a kind of thing that was <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This is two heads and it's communicating between two.
There's a few pills coming out and come into the head of this strange subject.
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a musician, a radio <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm, which is <unk> all the content we do in the world and a garden.
They take the box and all the people in it it strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But in order for this pill to have the pain, first by the stomach, your guts and other organs.
I'll take a pill that is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug would be able to make yourself effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- these are actually going to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known by their own side effects, in their negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the blood stream and get worse and worse than it is in its destination, which is where it's more important -- in the HIV policy.
These are regions of the body like <unk> <unk> the nervous system, our lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily come into the <unk> of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life managed by oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and diabetes surgery, you can use for anything <unk> including the drug transport of medicines.
In fact, we are using pulses of laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which opens up almost immediately cells living with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking yourself, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little laser beam on the cell cell membrane for HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even count, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> at the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, releases it directly at the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all of the investigator of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shooting at all.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent involvement to civic <unk>
I do field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, from <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need <unk> or <unk> in any successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes it when they don't <unk>
The armed fight and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent slum against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply to fire.
They're multitasking enough.
<unk> a complex machine of <unk> stations, radio channels TV and Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through <unk> business for example, construction construction.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their strength, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools running hospitals, they put in professional training programs, or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state cannot afford and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be seen as the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a stable price of the population.
But, in general, they provide social services that means filling a <unk> a gap <unk> by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups <unk> we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps by <unk> by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups involved in nonviolent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was a part of a territory, running all of their <unk> <unk> the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of <unk> and <unk> and the more weak people are the states, like in the Middle East the Middle East and <unk> that gap gap the actors.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
<unk> that empty gap has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace together.
If we understand the <unk> groups, we better understand what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some fights, but we're not giving us peace and stability.
So to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that gap gap to fill that vacuum emptiness that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the tag of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And so I felt like a bad feminist thing.
Or, at least, I wrote a article, and a book called "The <unk> and then the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young girl, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and the anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> which might be feminist ...
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a <unk> and unpleasant word.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with high self-worth and <unk> to believe that it's equal or higher to man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as whether or <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it in a easy way, and it's accessible to the contraceptives and service services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> physical, social condition, and much more.
We need to look at these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music to <unk>
Even though the lyrics degrades the women and it's a profound thing to me, the classic <unk> classic <unk> <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually get your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until <unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely wiped out by my musical concerns.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects -- the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink color is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay in home to raise her kids, they accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes financially vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that makes women economically vulnerable when they come in.
And we had this problem.
<unk> King of conventional <unk> has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women of color, and gay and gay and <unk> for white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist story.
It also happens to the following: Like <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put it up in a <unk>
We hope that we really hope that it is perfection.
When we get rid of them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I already consider myself to get rid of that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovators and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that drone means -- fear of not being able to be able to be able to be able to achieve any realistic expectations of life.
Take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist one.
In <unk> Music <unk> from 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> word.
It was a <unk> show to see this star of the pop star going openly feminism and asking women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started false debates if they were <unk> it was not a feminist issue.
He would raise her feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot so <unk>
We're going much beyond the sensible critical and <unk> to give us the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
evil feminism, or more right, an <unk> more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We moved to recognize our <unk> to give me the action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk>
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they change the change affecting effectively their profit.
It certainly is hard.
Why has his music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are told, it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two little girls and shiny <unk> and too brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
where they were being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies not treat women more than the <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, to participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't have enough of women, until it doesn't have enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to encourage you to participate in these sorts of projects, we can also encourage ourselves to be including more like us to be empowered to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we are not an <unk> <unk> without taking these <unk> our <unk> are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to people in power and producers of cinema and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions more and a significant difference.
We can also claim with bravery our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you, especially because <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
And a few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started thinking it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was typing.
And I went back to <unk>
I get involved in a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that was not anything.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I hold the ugly reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad thing: I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we all can be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because of being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly even <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and <unk> vaccines, disqualified and marked by being a Fulbright fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines would put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her believed to develop their whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising.
What's going on?
If they're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Disease Control what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so reduced in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the moral power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health care.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a childhood psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> <unk> to the people around him, including their own parents.
They could amuse them for hours by waving the hands in front of their faces, but they could take fun of the panic for <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy into his usual place without knowing it.
The foundation of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the major authority of the world on the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we were creating some of a lot as far away as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had turned to 9 percent of every 10 kids to send out for other doctors to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, have kept it carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills to put together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they hit the two.
When her mother put one favorite records, he correctly correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to the institutions for their own right, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as without support services without special education, and no special access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to defend before the <unk> of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
We took a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination in the dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit these little <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a bunch of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Initially, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year, to the article of <unk> and then buried it under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even an English translation of English, but luckily, the <unk> husband was German -- and he hated him for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning children were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with <unk> with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability, of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients as he called them their little teachers, and he turned to help the development of education methods that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> has seen autism as a diverse continuum that included a surprising variety of gifts and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one broad and <unk>
These changes didn't fell in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith were working backstage -- to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents from the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the very early clinics that use to diagnose autism.
No longer had a connection with that little circle of experts to make a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were waiting for it to be out of it, making people with autism and their families finally supported the support and services that were <unk>
And so Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for increasing <unk> and <unk> and <unk> unique history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are puzzles to solve the new breakthroughs -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social, and suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> autistic people have a hard deal in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are found in the realization of teachers, employers with ability, communities, communities and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all of the hands on deck for <unk> the boat from <unk>
As we moved into an future, we need all of the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
